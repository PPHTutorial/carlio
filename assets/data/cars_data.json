            "article": "The veil was lifted on a new Ferrari One-Off model from the Special Projects programme: the Ferrari SC40. Designed by Ferrari’s Styling Centre under the direction of Flavio Manzoni, the SC40 is a mid-rear-engined V6 that takes its architecture, chassis, and powertrain from the 296 GTB. The Ferrari SC40 thus joins the most exclusive segment of the range — that of unique, tailor-made cars, designed and built around the desires of a single client, representing the highest expression of Ferrari’s personalisation philosophy.The car’s name pays tribute to the F40, the legendary Ferrari supercar unveiled in July 1987. The SC40 echoes its sharp, angular lines, which are skillfully combined with softer surface transitions, giving the car a contemporary feel and a strong, unmistakable identity. The SC40 is an entirely new and unique design. The “SC40” script engraved in relief on the side of the wing is a clear homage to the iconic Ferrari supercar, yet the goal was not to create a literal reinterpretation, but rather a model with its own distinct personality.The styling theme draws inspiration from industrial design, defined by precise geometries and muscular, squared volumes. The proportions feature a long, low nose balanced by a short rear overhang and a high, fixed rear wing — painted in the car’s bespoke SC40 White — which flows from the body’s flanks. The fixed wing extends vertically from the engine cover and merges seamlessly with it, highlighted by a black separation line that enhances the black rear fascia. This area is composed of an open mesh revealing the mechanical and structural components beneath. The V6 engine is showcased through distinctive, smoked Lexan® louvres, which connect visually to the lower air intake and are echoed by smaller louvres carved into the muscular rear wings near the wheelarches. The sculpted rear section is completed by a central exhaust produced in additive manufacturing and featuring titanium and carbon-fibre tips, and by taillights that clearly hint at the 296 GTB which the car is based on.The side view is dominated by the intercooler air intakes — a reinterpretation of the classic NACA duct accentuated by a large triangular carbon-fibre plate. The visual rhythm of the design is defined by vertical lines that precisely outline the crisp edges of the front wings, door cuts, and engine cover. These vertical strokes form a subtle underlying grid, structuring the car’s visual tension almost like a musical score.At the front, the design is strongly characterised by the headlights placed at the outer corners, integrated into a black housing that extends downwards to connect with the lower air intake. This intake spans the entire front bumper, giving the car a striking, assertive appearance, further emphasised by two rectangular frames outlining the redesigned brake air intakes, above which sit the daytime running lights.Inside, particular attention was given to the use of Kevlar, a material that strongly recalls the F40. The carbon-Kevlar has been reinterpreted and redeveloped for this project, and features in the footwells, behind the seats, and on parts of the floor mats. This distinctive material is also used for the steering wheel, some dashboard inserts, the engine bay, and the luggage compartment. The upholstery features a combination of Charcoal Alcantara® and a red Jacquard technical fabric, while the Prancing Horse on the headrests and the woven SC40 logo give the seats a contemporary and exclusive look.The SC40 White exterior colour, developed specifically for this car, features a cool hue that accentuates the body’s curves in sunlight, recalling the colour of the carbon-Kevlar used inside. The SC40 logo appears only on the right side of the car, while the fuel filler and charging caps are made of aluminium with a brushed finish. The Ferrari lettering, rendered in negative on the rear engine cover, reveals the carbon beneath. The wheels, designed exclusively for this model, combine brushed metal on the diamond-cut surfaces with black spokes that emphasise their geometric form."

            "article": "As it unveils the Audi Concept C study in Milan, Audi is offering a definitive preview of the design of future models. The four rings are taking a progressive step: in an increasingly complex world, Audi is uncompromising in its commitment to clarity. The new design philosophy is part of Audi's fundamental realignment and represents a new beginning for the company as a whole. Products, processes, and structures are focused on what is essential, creating space for innovation and technological leadership.Held under the banner “Strive for clarity,” the event in Milan also marks the next chapter in the company's transformation. With a design that focuses on clarity, Audi is taking a bold step towards a reduced and timeless aesthetic that will continue to differentiate the company in times of increased competition. It is no coincidence that this new beginning is taking place in a city that has stood for design, technology, and remarkable personalities for centuries. Today, few ideas continue to inspire as much as those of the Renaissance. “Visionary thinking and a drive to go beyond the familiar are exemplary to Audi,” says Audi CEO Gernot Döllner. That is why Italy’s design capital is the perfect place to begin a new era. Here, the ideal that Audi pursues becomes tangible.The new approach is made apparent by a design language that unmistakably embodies the brand's identity.Audi stands for distinctive design, uncompromising quality, and sophistication.“Radical simplicity is at the heart of our approach. We achieve clarity by reducing everything to the essential,” says Chief Creative Officer Massimo Frascella. This not only applies to the vehicles’ exteriors, but also to their interiors. The latest technological innovations and materials are used precisely wherever they enable new possibilities for customers – and minimal measures have maximal impact.For Frascella, this approach is about what makes a car desirable beyond rational experience. Emotions thus play an important part in the design philosophy. “We want to shape a brand capable of inspiring desire and creating cultural impact.”The Audi Concept C, which will be on show at IAA in Munich, is the first manifestation of this new design philosophy. The concept car previews the design of future products and a new interior experience, embodying universal design principles: a reduction to the essential – without superfluous lines or elements – and a commitment to geometric clarity. It is defined by the vertical frame inspired by the iconic Auto Union Type C racing car. The vehicle design's vertical orientation focuses the gaze. Reduction to the essential is also reflected in the interior, which frees users from distractions and provides the right information at the right time through intelligent technology.“Our history is marked by bold leaps in innovation and state-of-the-art technology combined with an uncompromising focus on clarity in design,” emphasizes Audi CEO Gernot Döllner. “Our most legendary models perfectly embody this combination.” Audi’s quattro all-wheel drive system revolutionized the automotive world. In motorsport, the brand triumphed thanks to powerful engines, innovative materials, and aerodynamic design – a recipe for success that has influenced vehicle development far beyond the racetrack.A return to what exemplifies Audi and a reduction to the essential play a central role not only in design: “The way we design our vehicles is the way we will shape our company,” says Gernot Döllner. The new design philosophy is therefore a corporate principle for Audi that will be reflected in the design of the model portfolio and the product range as well as in the organizational structure of the company. Döllner: “Clarity is an ethos and the compass that will guide Audi through the times ahead.”The presentation of the new design philosophy in Milan represents a new beginning. “The phase of taking stock is over. Now is the time to look to the future and pick up speed. We are focusing on what really matters to set standards in design and quality,” says the Audi CEO.The company has been pushing for profound changes since 2023 with its Audi Agenda. In the first half of 2025, Audi continued to press ahead with their implementation in order to strengthen its innovative capabilities and future-proof its business model.“We are now seeing initial successes,” said Döllner. “For example, with our model initiative and with our focused portfolio, which enables us to invest in quality and innovation. Or in our business model for China, where we have once again demonstrated pioneering spirit with our new sister brand AUDI.” The agreement for the future reached by the Board of Management and the Works Council in March also strengthens the company's future-proofing and competitiveness. Furthermore, Audi is investing around eight billion euros in its German sites by 2029.By the end of this year, Audi will have introduced more than 20 new models within 24 months making its portfolio the youngest in the premium segment. Following the replacement of core models such as the Audi A6 in spring and the Audi Q3 in summer, the four rings will showcase the Q3 Sportback e-hybrid at the IAA.Audi is set to continue its model initiative next year. Further additions will include a fully electric entry-level model, which will be produced in Ingolstadt from 2026, and performance models from Audi Sport. The combination of all-electric models, plug-in hybrids, and a new generation of combustion-engine vehicles will secure a robust and flexible position in the core markets of Europe, China and North America as the transition to electric mobility progresses.At the same time, Audi is already working on the next innovation cycle. Strategic partnerships such as that between Volkswagen Group and Rivian enable innovations to be developed more quickly and cost-efficiently – especially those regarding software. In 2026, Audi will also be entering Formula 1: an opportunity to test new technologies, materials, and processes in the world's toughest technology laboratory. Gernot Döllner: “Preparations for our start in Formula 1 are moving at full speed.” And just a few weeks after the unveiling of the new design philosophy in Milan, another exciting moment for the four rings is already on the horizon: “We look forward to giving all fans a concrete preview of what to expect from us in Formula 1 starting next year.”"

            "article": "capricorn GROUP (capricorn), the German-based industry leader in automotive and motorsport lightweight technology, has today unveiled the first limited-edition hypercar to carry the company’s name. Featuring a body designed by Zagato, the capricorn 01 Zagato is a mid-engined, rear-wheel-drive, manual transmission hypercar, engineered and handbuilt by capricorn in Germany to deliver a pure, immersive, analog driving experience.The capricorn 01 Zagato prioritizes true lightweight technology and purity of driving over simply excessive horsepower. A 5.2-liter supercharged V8 engine producing more than 900 PS (subject to final homologation results) and 1,000 Nm of torque. Featuring a full LMP1-type carbon fiber structure and carbon fiber body, the capricorn 01 Zagato weighs less than 1,200 kg, ensuring an excellent power-toweight ratio, exceptional agility, and a 0-100km/h acceleration time of less than 3.0 seconds.The capricorn 01 Zagato also represents the culmination of a belief shared by capricorn Founder and CEO Robertino Wild and Zagato President Andrea Michele Zagato as to what a true driver’s car should stand for. The two men enjoy a longstanding business relationship and a deep personal friendship, giving the project a special character and providing a strong foundation to combine German engineering discipline with Italian design flair.Production of the capricorn 01 Zagato will be strictly limited to a run of just 19 coupes as a tribute to Zagato’s founding year, 19th April 1919. This number holds particular significance for the design house and serves as a nod to its history of creating highly sought-after, ultra-limited, collectible hypercars. The entire series will be offered exclusively through prominent premium and luxury automotive retailer Louyet Group.With a heritage dating back to 1933, capricorn is a global leader in five key technologies with focus on lightweight: composites, forging, machining, casting, and additive manufacturing. The company has proven its competency at the highest level of world motorsport, supplying bespoke components for Formula 1, LMP1, World Endurance Championship (WEC), World Rally Championship (WRC) teams, and others.For decades, capricorn has helped deliver success for its partners in global motorsport and in the luxury high-performance automotive OEM sector. While the majority of the company’s work is confidential, projects in the public domain include collaborations with Lotus and Caterham in Formula 1, with Peugeot Sport in Le Mans, and significant involvement in Porsche’s LMP1 program. The company also has a highly successful history with Volkswagen Motorsport in the WRC and with Peugeot Sport on the Dakar Rally.“The capricorn 01 Zagato represents the culmination of everything we have learnt from decades of pioneering ultra-lightweight materials, technologies and construction techniques,” explains capricorn CEO Robertino Wild. “This car is a showcase of capricorn’s comprehensive capabilities. It demonstrates precisely what capricorn can do when it combines all of its different technologies and skills to engineer, develop, and build an entire car.“The project elevates capricorn to the next level, positioning the group as a manufacturer that can produce a pre-series car or assemble an entire series for an OEM, or indeed any customer. It proves that capricorn is capable of managing complex projects to OEM standards, and it also establishes capricorn as a high-end automotive manufacturer in its own right.”Until now, capricorn may be a name that many automotive enthusiasts may have heard of, though they will certainly be very familiar with the company’s work, Zagato, however, is a name that speaks for itself. The company’s president, Andrea Michele Zagato, is the grandson of the visionary designer and coachbuilder, Ugo Zagato, who founded the company in 1919.“Over the past century, we have had the honor of partnering with many iconic car brands such as Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Lancia, Maserati, Porsche, and more than forty others to design highly exclusive and elegant collectible limited-edition vehicles,” explains Zagato President, Andrea Michele Zagato.“Until now, though, Zagato has never designed a hypercar. I am delighted that the first hypercar ever to feature a Zagato-designed body has been created in partnership with my dear friend Robertino Wild, and his highly experienced technical team at capricorn. And I am also proud that by combining Italian design flair with German engineering discipline and holding steadfast to the vision that Robertino and I share on what a true driver’s car should be – we have brought a unique and highly collectible proposition to the market.”“While it looks like nothing else on the road today, the capricorn 01 Zagato is not a car from a sci-fi movie or a game; it is a car that can take its place in the history of the automobile with confidence. Naturally, it reflects capricorn’s lightweight engineering values and Zagato’s proud design heritage. Still, more than that, it reflects the vision and the personalities of the two men who created it, Robertino Wild and Andrea Michele Zagato,” reveals Norihiko Harada, Chief Designer, Zagato.“From the start, it was critical that Zagato’s first hypercar should stun people with an aura of modernity and an intensely avant-garde nature. Andrea was very clear on that and Robertino was always pushing me to go further and further. This was fantastic as it gave my team and me complete freedom, which is not always the case with designing a car for a client.“Above all, though, the design of the capricorn 01 Zagato had to stand the test of time – the test of decades, not years. I am confident that it can today sit alongside beautiful cars from other eras, a 1930s Bugatti or a 1960s Aston Martin, for example, and look perfectly at home in any collection. And it should still look as good in 40- or 50-years’ time: I believe that we have achieved precisely that.”Yet another stunning visual dimension is provided by the gullwing doors. To minimize weight, the side mirrors are mounted on the front fenders, rather than on the doors. No consideration was given to using cameras as they would have detracted from the purity of the car’s timeless character.From the very first stages of the design process, Zagato worked in parallel with capricorn and several external partners, who supplied comprehensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis data to ensure that technical performance was fully embedded with the emotional, timeless design.In many ways, these precise technical requirements helped Zagato shape the car’s visual character, as Harada reveals: “The capricorn 01 Zagato has a lot of air intake and air outlets, which characterize the vehicle’s overall aesthetic, while providing aerodynamic and cooling functionality. The most striking is the large air intake at the rear, behind the driver’s door, where the surface of the door is used to channel air to the intake. A pin-sharp design line runs over the front fender and along the door before seeming to ‘disappear’ into the air intake, and then suddenly ‘reappearing’ on the external surface of the car again to sweep over the rear fender.”The capricorn 01 Zagato does not need to rely upon a visually ostentatious aerodynamic package with large wings to generate downforce. Instead of using large wings, it generates significant, and crucially, consistent levels of downforce passively through internal airflow management and the design of the underfloor, including the front and rear diffusers. Additionally, a subtle rear airfoil is semlessly integrated into the design, working in conjunction with the diffuser.“As with our approach to horsepower, the aim was to create a car with usable levels of downforce that an ordinary driver could access and utilize,” explains Wild. “Our target was to achieve a constant and predictable downforce distribution for stability, not an ultra-high-downforce number with a narrow operating window that would make the hypercar nervous and challenging to drive. This is a car that can also be enjoyed by regular, skilled drivers, not just racing drivers."

            "article": "Mercedes-Benz has entered a new era of iconic design. Representing this evolution, Vision Iconic show car embodies the freedom to think beyond convention - as a creative impulse that opens new perspectives and builds a bridge between past and future. Besides an opulent yet timeless presence, a central feature is the reinterpretation of one of the most recognisable elements in automotive history: the iconic Mercedes-Benz radiator grille. This so-called iconic grille, first introduced with the all-new electric GLC, expresses both emotion and intelligence, and enables Mercedes-Benz to stand out from the sea of sameness.“Vision Iconic embodies our vision for the future of mobility. With groundbreaking innovations such as neuromorphic computing, steer-by-wire, solar paint, and Level 4 highly automated driving, along with state-of-the-art technology, we are setting new standards for the electric and digital age. This beautiful vehicle is a testament to our commitment to making the mobility of tomorrow a reality today.\" Markus Schäfer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes‑Benz Group AG, Chief Technology Officer, Development & Procurement„Inspired by the golden era of automotive design of the 1930s, this show car embodies the pure essence of Mercedes-Benz. With its seemingly hood giving it a majestic presence, sculptural flowing lines, and a touch of Art Deco, it rises to become a true icon of automotive beauty. The interior with its continuous bench seat and the elegant rear, evoking memories of the legendary 300 SL. Our Vision Iconic is more than just an automobile – it is a sculpture in motion, a homage to timeless elegance, and a statement for the future. The symbiosis of traditional craftsmanship, state-of-the-art technology, and an unmistakable design language makes it the ultimate expression of value, prestige, and grace: the most beautiful, most prestigious kind of thing.” Gorden Wagener, Chief Design Officer Mercedes-Benz Group AGThe front is defined by the iconic grille. It is a striking, forward-looking homage to the traditional chrome grille, which as a key design element has shaped the face of Mercedes-Benz for over 100 years. The iconic grille draws inspiration from the upright grilles of legendary models such as the W 108, W 111 and the Mercedes-Benz 600 Pullman. With its wide chromed frame, a smoked-glass lattice structure and integrated contour lighting the iconic grille merges heritage with digital modernity. It radiates presence, status and a strong sense of Mercedes-Benz identity. This new face of the brand was first introduced with the all-new electric GLC in September 2025. Vision Iconic builds on this strong presence by even illuminating the upright star on the bonnet.Vision Iconic perfectly demonstrates the brand’s elevated design language by refining the iconic grille - bold, upright and proud - to a digital status front and by integrating the brightly illuminated star on the bonnet. The illumination of the iconic star and the chrome grille in combination with animation scenarios for the grille demonstrate the importance of light integration for the emotionalisation of digital design. The distinctive front design is enriched through slim, modern and self-confident headlights infused with the latest lighting technology. The deep black high-gloss paint finish emphasises the sculptural exterior design of the show car.With automated driving, the role of the car's interior is evolving. Vision Iconic offers a glimpse into this future, characterised by lounge-like comfort and an entirely new experience of hyper-analogue and digital luxury.The interior of Vision Iconic redefines automotive elegance through an opulent Art Deco-inspired composition of finest craftsmanship and exclusive materials. The centrepiece of the instrument panel is a floating glass structure, the so called “Zeppelin” - a sculptural form that reveals a captivating interior of artfully designed details and a refined interplay of analogue and digital instruments.As the door is opened, the instrument cluster comes to life with a cinematic, entirely analogue animation inspired by high-end chronographs. The pillar to pillar screen concept blends technology seamlessly into the interior. At the centre, one of the four clocks is shaped like the brand logo, acting as an AI companion.Behind the Zeppelin, a generous decorative surface unfolds into a breathtaking inlay of lustrous mother-of-pearl look, offering both visual depth and artisanal finesse. Intricate mother-of-Pearl marquetry also graces the door panels, encircling finely crafted and polished brass door handles in silver-gold tones before flowing into a radiant, star pattern that frames the rear seat with elegance. Driver and passenger can share the spacious, sumptuously upholstered front bench seat in deep blue velvet - fostering a sense of joint relaxation and luxury experience.In front of the driver the four spoke steering wheel highlights a sporty yet elegant character. The Mercedes-Benz logo floats inside a glass sphere, clasped by the spokes like a jewel. The vehicle floor is clad in elaborate straw marquetry, a luxurious decorative technique dating back to the 17th century and revived in the 1920s. Rendered in a classic fan-shaped Art Deco motif, this handcrafted finish brings historic artistry into the modern era.Mercedes-Benz is researching innovative solar modules that could be seamlessly applied to the bodywork of electric vehicles, similar to a wafer-thin paste. The photovoltaic-active surface could be adaptable to various substrates. When applied to the entire vehicle surface of the Iconic Vision, additional range could be harnessed from the sun, depending on geographical location and local conditions. As an example, an area of 11 square metres (equivalent to the surface of a mid-size SUV) could produce energy for up to 12,000 kilometres a year under ideal conditions1. The coating does not contain any rare earths or silicon and can be easily recycled. The solar cells have a high efficiency of 20 percent and generate energy continuously – even when the vehicle is switched off.Future vehicle models like Vision Iconic will include more and more functionalities, such as autonomous driving. This will lead to significantly higher energy requirements. Efficiency is therefore a crucial factor. With its research into artificial neural networks, Mercedes-Benz is breaking new ground in the development of computer architectures together with partners from research and industry. Neuromorphic computing mimics the functioning of the human brain. This could make AI calculations significantly more energy-efficient and faster. Safety systems, for example, could better recognise traffic signs, lanes, and other road users and react faster, even in poor visibility conditions – and would be 10 times more efficient than current systems. Neuromorphic computing has the potential to reduce the energy requirements for data processing in autonomous driving by 90 percent compared to today's systems.As a true pioneer, Mercedes-Benz stands at the forefront of development in assisted and automated driving systems. Thanks to our sophisticated safety based approach, further enhanced Level 2 point-to-point urban capabilities come standard in Vision Iconic.With this system, Mercedes-Benz offers expert handling of complex urban traffic scenarios, with cooperative steering and acceleration as a unique feature. It helps the driver navigate busy streets in the world’s biggest cities. The logical next development step to conditionally automated driving would be to prepare a car like Vision Iconic with a Level 4 highly automated driving system. After entering the freeway and activating the Level 4 system, the driver could use the time to relax without having to deal with traffic at all. It would be also possible and permissible to take a nap or get comfortable while streaming the latest trending video including an immersive sound and ambient light experience. The car becomes a luxurious lounge.After arriving at the destination, relaxed and refreshed, one would step out of Vision Iconic and let the Mercedes handle the rest. With the highly automated parking feature utilising the car’s sophisticated sensor architecture, Mercedes-Benz gives its customers back time, since no driver is needed for parking. Without the limitation to any infrastructure the Level 4 parking function is available for nearly all parking scenarios.With steer-by-wire a completely new steering experience combined with maximum safety becomes reality at Mercedes-Benz. Especially the perfect interaction with rear-axle steering for a long car like Vision Iconic the advantages of this technology become obvious: handling would improve and manoeuvring and parking would become easier. This is because steer-by-wire can further reduce the effort required and it eliminates the need to re-grip the steering wheel while parking. This technology does not require a mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the front wheels. Instead, the driver's steering requests are transmitted quickly and electrical via control units and actuators.Furthermore, steer-by-wire leads to more flexibility in interior design. In combination with future conditionally and highly automated driving systems like ADAS, the driver could have an even more relaxed position – for example on the spacious, sumptuously upholstered bench seat in Vision Iconic.Together with the show car, Mercedes-Benz is presenting a capsule collection consisting of six carefully designed outfits for men and women. With dark blue nuances and silver-gold accents, the outfits not only reflect the luxurious colour scheme of Vision Iconic but also play with the graphic elements of the show car’s interior. In this way, the collection captures the essence of Art Deco by combining the lavish luxury of the 1920s and 1930s with the finest craftsmanship and exquisite materials. Each piece celebrates the attention to detail and the use of distinctively chosen fabrics that are characteristic of this iconic period. The capsule collection pays homage to the Shanghai Fashion Week, which takes place during the world premiere of Vision Iconic.This approach is now summarised for the first time ever in the ICONIC DESIGN Book. Deeply inspired by the brands heritage, the book was developed by the Mercedes-Benz design team and is a gateway to understanding the “New Iconic Era” at Mercedes-Benz. It illustrates how Mercedes-Benz stands out in a sea of sameness, highlighting that uniqueness lies not only in the new iconic grille but also in the knowledge and craftsmanship that come with the rich heritage that only Mercedes-Benz possesses. The book features exclusive interviews with Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kaellenius and Chief Design Officer Gorden Wagener, along with stunning imagery and a glimpse of another show car."

            "article": "Aston Martin is proud to announce a new DB12 halo model, the DB12 S. Taking the thrilling, driver-focussed DB12 as its start point, DB12 S builds on that pioneering recipe of intensely dynamic ultra-luxury performance by adding more power and even greater dynamic prowess. Together with striking exterior changes and extensive interior enhancements, DB12 S is the new pinnacle of Super Tourer.Joining DBX S and Vantage S, DB12 S is the latest to honour Aston Martin’s long tradition of applying the ‘S’ suffix to the highest performing derivative of an established model. This custom began in 1953 with the glorious DB3S road racer. More recent examples include the first and second generation Vanquish S – launched in 2004 and 2016 respectively - V8 and V12 Vantage S models introduced in 2011 and 2013, and the magnificent four-seater Rapide S, also launched in 2013.The heart of the DB12 S is an even more potent version of the formidable Aston Martin 4.0-Litre Twin-Turbo V8. Now with 700PS @ 6000rpm - an increase of 20PS - and 800Nm delivered between 3000 and 6000rpm, the DB12 S offers scintillating response, relentless acceleration and a 202mph top speed.In keeping with this intensified spirit, DB12 S features a distinctive new exhaust sound character. The new quad tailpipe stainless steel sports exhaust system has been tuned to accentuate the engine frequencies throughout the rev range for added depth and potency. An optional titanium exhaust system amplifies that soundtrack, further boosting the bass, mid and treble frequencies uplifting the sound level by 1.5dB. while also reducing weight by 11.7kg compared to the stainless steel system.Calibration changes to the powertrain have optimised the Launch Control system, reducing gearshift times by more than 50% and contributing to a 0.1sec improvement in 0-60mph time, which is now just 3.4 seconds. Aston Martin engineers have further honed the throttle pedal calibration, introducing a more progressive throttle pedal feel with a new S-specific drive-by-wire throttle map to give the driver an even greater sense of connection and control.An extensive package of chassis changes, target a commensurate increase in the driver’s sense of agility, connection and precision together with improvements in feel and composure. Software changes to the Bilstein DTX dampers to improve roll and pitch control work in harmony with a stiffer rear anti-roll bar and finessed camber, toe and castor geometry settings. Combining these changes bring improvements in front-end confidence and overall agility feel.Additional tuning of the steering calibration and electronic rear differential (E-diff) has enabled Aston Martin’s chassis engineers to dial-in further connection and response for even more natural and intuitive feel. With the ability to use more throttle earlier in the corner for maximum satisfaction from corner entry to exit, DB12 S achieves an impeccable balance of agility and exploitability, together with an underlying stability for ultimate confidence and enjoyment.Another significant upgrade for the DB12 S is the standard fitment of Carbon Ceramic Brakes (CCB). Offering increased braking performance and thermal capacity together with a significant reduction in unsprung weight, the CCBs – 410mm diameter at the front, 360mm at the rear - combine linear brake response and consistent pedal feel with exceptional resistance to fade. They also save 27kg of unsprung weight compared to steel brakes, which brings benefits to ride quality, steering feel and dynamic handling behaviour.The DB12 S also benefits from the next generation of corner braking control system (CBC), which optimises interaction between the Integrated Brake Slip Control and the Integrated Vehicle Control modules. A predictive function within the CBC allows the car to maintain optimum stability while trail braking into a corner, using more of the rear braking performance to maintain a tighter line from corner entry to apex.This system allows the driver to brake later and with improved stability, the Integrated Brake Slip Control system providing torque vectoring across the rear axle to provide predictable, precise and consistent cornering behaviour in all driving environments, from twisting country roads, high-speed highway junction exits or driving on a racetrack.Aston Martin Director of Vehicle Performance, Simon Newton said “The technology we introduced with the DB12 now allows us exceptional scope to explore a new depth of character and capability within the same vehicle platform. With DB12 S we have carefully engineered a host of detailed changes, which, preserve signature levels of refinement, boost vehicle performance and amplify driver engagement. Having added this greater dynamic and performance bandwidth to DB12 S, we believe this elevates the Super Tourer ethos to a thrilling new level.”Visually, the new DB12 S reflects its significantly bolstered performance and sporting feel with a striking new look. Starting at the front, the DB12 S is identified by new dual element front splitter and new bonnet louvres, with each performing a functional and aesthetic role.The splitter visually lowers and widens the DB12 S to create a more assertive look, while also generating downforce and guiding airflow in and around the front wheel arches to stabilise airflow and further reduce lift. The bonnet louvres – finished in gloss black or optional 2x2 Twill Carbon Fibre - aid extraction of hot air from the ‘hot-V’ configured 4.0-litre V8 while completing DB12 S’s more aggressive frontal aspect.Moving to the flanks, DB12 S features gloss black sill additions. These continue the line formed by the new front splitter, further enhancing the ground-hugging stance. DB12 S also continues the tradition of carrying S badges in key locations. Specifically, on the fenders just below each side strake. Featuring a hand-made, in either bright or dark chrome, forged ‘S’ badge completed with red glass enamel, it is a discreet but enduring mark of performance.The rear design of the DB12 S makes an emphatic statement, capturing the essence of boosted power, sharpened dynamics and an unforgettable soundtrack. Once again aerodynamics play a major role, the fixed rear spoiler adding drama and increasing high speed stability. Below sits the new rear diffuser, which reduces lift while allowing space for the DB12 S signature stacked pairs of exhaust tailpipes, which are framed within a broader rear bumper for maximum visual impact.In common with its ‘S’ badged stablemates in the revitalised Aston Martin range, the interior of DB12 S features a host of distinguishing details unique to the halo model. Foremost amongst these is a red anodised finish to the knurled metal drive mode rotary controller, which also informs the colour of the seatbelts, contrast seat welts, contrast stitching and headrest embroidery.Amongst the enticing options offered on DB12 S are an Alcantara® heated sports steering wheel, and the iconic Aston Martin wings applied to the seat headrests by an industry-first technique using both embossing and debossing for unprecedented precision and sculptural depth.DB12 S comes with a choice of three interior trim environments; Accelerate leather and Alcantara trim, Inspire S semi-aniline leather and Alcantara and Inspire S full semi-aniline leather. Both Inspire S packages include S Herringbone quilting with micro-perforations and an Alcantara headlining. DB12 S is fitted with 16-way Sport Plus electric front seats as standard, plus the option of a Carbon Fibre Performance seat."

            "article": "Ferrari has chosen Capital Markets Day 2025, as the occasion to reveal the production-ready chassis and components of its new electric car, the first full-electric model in the history of the Prancing Horse. This model is a milestone in the brand’s multi-energy strategy, which encompasses internal combustion engines, HEV and PHEV powertrains, and now, fully electric drive.The product of a radically new and innovative approach, the new Ferrari Elettrica combines state of the art technology with superlative performance and the extraordinary driving pleasure that distinguishes every Ferrari model. Remaining true to the marque’s engineering and artisanal traditions, each of the main components of this car has been developed and is manufactured in-house to ensure that the new Ferrari Elettrica also delivers the peerless levels of performance and uniqueness that only Ferrari can offer.This car can be considered the culmination of a long journey of technological research into electrification that began with the first hybrid solutions derived from the 2009 Formula 1 car. From the 599 HY-KERS prototype of 2010 to the 2013 LaFerrari del 2013, and from the SF90 Stradale – the Maranello-based marque’s first plug-in hybrid – and the 296 GTB to the 849 Testarossa presented recently, Ferrari has built and consolidated the know-how needed to develop an electric car capable of excelling in every dimension.The strategy leading Ferrari towards the first electric model in its history was clear from the outset: that a model such as this would only be introduced once the technology available could ensure the superlative performance and authentic driving experience befitting the values of the brand. The project is now ready to go into production and boasts over 60 patented proprietary technological solutions. For the first time, both the chassis and bodyshell are manufactured with 75% recycled aluminium, contributing to an astonishing overall saving of 6.7 tons of CO2 for every vehicle built.The architecture features short overhangs, an advanced driving position close to the front axle, and a battery integrated completely into the floorpan. The modules are installed between the front and rear axles, with 85% of them concentrated in the lowest position possible to lower the centre of gravity and benefit driving dynamics. Notably, the Ferrari Elettrica gains a dynamic edge from a centre of gravity 80 mm lower than an equivalent ICE model.At the rear, Ferrari has introduced the first separate subframe in its history. It has been designed to reduce noise and vibration perceived in the cabin while still ensuring the stiffness and driving dynamics expected from a car from Maranello. The third generation of the 48 V active suspension system - originally introduced on the Purosangue and evolved for the F80 - takes ride comfort, body control and vehicle dynamics to even greater heights by distributing cornering forces optimally over the four wheels.The first all-electric Ferrari is equipped with two electric axles developed and built entirely in-house, each with a pair of synchronous permanent magnet engines and Halbach array rotors derived from F1 technology and industrialised for a series production application. The front axle has a power density of 3.23 kW/kg and an efficiency of 93% at peak power, while the rear axle attains a power density of 4.8 kW/kg and the same peak efficiency. Capable of delivering up to 300 kW, the front inverter is fully integrated into the axle and weighs just 9 kg.Designed and assembled in Maranello, the battery has an energy density of almost 195 Wh/kg – the highest of any electric car – and features a cooling system designed to optimise heat distribution and performance.The three driving modes available – Range, Tour and Performance – determine how energy, available power and traction are managed. The paddles behind the steering wheel let the driver access five progressively higher levels of torque and power delivery to offer a sensation of gradual acceleration and involvement.The dynamic parameters acquired by the Vehicle Control Unit are updated 200 times per second to predictively manage suspension, traction and steering functions and ensure unparalleled agility, stability and precision.And then the sound – a distinctive trait of every Ferrari – has been developed to accentuate the unique characteristics of the electric powertrain. A high precision sensor picks up the mechanical vibrations of the powertrain components, which are amplified to offer an authentic aural experience that reflects the dynamic driving experience and provides the driver with direct aural feedback.The unveiling of the new Electric Ferrari will continue in early 2026 with a preview of the look-and-feel of the interior design concepts. A few months later, in spring next year, the journey will culminate with the World Premiere where this harmonious blend of technology and design will be revealed."

            "article": "Vittori, a visionary new hypercar company with roots in both America and Italy, has debuted its inaugural vehicle this October in Miami. This limited-run hybrid hypercar, based on an original visual concept by Vittori and designed in partnership with the legendary Italian design house Pininfarina, will feature a perfect package of impeccable production, quality, craftsmanship, aesthetics, and of course, speed. Headquartered in the U.S. but manufactured in Italy, Vittori’s debut represents a fusion of timeless artistry and cutting-edge technology, redefining what is possible for our future while also respecting the beloved aesthetics and qualities of classic car design.ounder and CEO, Carlos Cruz, began Vittori after a career scaling multi-million-dollar businesses across finance, tech, and AI industries. Cruz notes, “Our dream was to create a beautiful, high-speed vehicle that evoked emotion and a sense of connection. We didn’t want to make another supercar—we wanted to build something that feels like flight, like sculpture, like power at your fingertips. We sought to build a reality where performance, beauty, control, and freedom could exist in one car—without compromise.”The model debuting in Miami is a running concept, just the beginning of Vittori’s journey towards the production version. The key to the vehicle’s debut is a design deeply rooted in both legacy and innovation. The Vittori team aimed to prioritize craftsmanship, old-world artistry, and a timeless Italian presence. To achieve this vision, they collaborated with Italian icon Pininfarina, the global design house behind some of the most enduring silhouettes in automotive history, including models for Ferrari and Maserati, to drive Vittori’s concept development, dream manufacturing, and the production of exclusive limited series. Pininfarina’s expert understanding of not only materiality, but their unparalleled experience with designing silhouettes and interiors built for velocity, top-tier ergonomics, and superior functionality, made them the perfect partner for this debut vehicle.“Partnering with Vittori on a new vision for the hypercar market embodies one of the essential traits of Pininfarina,” states Giuseppe Bonollo, SVP Mobility Pininfarina. “For decades, Pininfarina has leveraged its heritage in coachbuilding and its ability to transform pure design exercises into industrial realities through comprehensive, turn-key solutions. These skills remain paramount at Pininfarina in serving global customers, and we are therefore pleased to support Vittori in its mission.”Debuting this October in Miami, the first Vittori vehicle will be a limited-run hybrid hypercar, with only 50 cars available for purchase. The car will debut as a proprietary powertrain developed by Italtecnica, showcasing advanced aerodynamics and additive manufacturing technology. The exterior design is driven by aerodynamic performance. The clean, pure, and seamless body surfaces naturally integrate with the air intakes and exhausts required for cooling flow management. The active rear wing allows the driver to reduce drag or increase downforce depending on the route and driving style. Inside, Vittori also stands apart by putting the driver back in control. Instead of filling the cabin with touchscreens, physical controls and switches have been meticulously restored, placing every element with intent to bring back the pure thrill of mechanical engagement.More details will be available in the coming months, following the car’s debut in October."

            "article": "At the first motor show after the end of the First World War, the 1919 Paris Auto Salon, Marc Birkigt launched a new luxury model, the H6. For many years the six cylinder Hispano Suiza's refinement and built quality remained unmatched.In the War, Hispano Suiza had supplied over 50,000 V12 fighter plane engines. For his new top of the line model, Birkigt first intended to use a version of the well proven V12. After some tests he concluded that one bank of a V12 would be more than sufficient to propel the new car. The 'six' displaced just over 6.5 litres and featured a single overhead camshaft. Each 35 lb crankshaft was machined from a 600 lb billet, resulting in a very rigid crankshaft. This was typical for Birkigt's 'no cost spared' perfectionism.For the block and head aluminium was used, to keep the weight of the engine down. In the block a six separate steel sleeves formed the cylinders. Ignition was through two coils, with two plugs per cylinder, one on each side of the engine. The overhead camshaft was shaft driven and operated the valves, which were set vertical in the block. This was unconventional setup, which could result in tremendous damage, if a valve dropped in the cylinder. Birkigt was confident in using it, as the valves had never failed on the V12 airplane engines.Finished in black enamel and polished aluminium, the engine was mounted in a conventional ladder frame. It was suspended by a live axle and semi-elliptic leaf springs all-round. The four drum brakes were power assisted by a patented 'servobrake' system. The ingenious system used the car's momentum to slow it down. The brake assistance system took the power from the gearbox, which drove a shaft at 1/64 the speed of the engine. If all else failed, the rear brakes could be activated using a hand lever.Built in Paris and later in the Czech Republic as well, the H6 offered luxury, speed and refinement. Many of Hispano Suiza's European competitors like Rolls Royce, Bentley and Isotta Fraschini offered one or two of these ingredients, but not until the late 1920s did another manufacturer come up to par with the H6. This complete package did not come cheaply and for a while the H6 was the most expensive European car available. In 1922 the slightly more powerful H6B replaced the H6 and in 1924 the 8-litre H6C was added to the line-up.Production of the H6B ended in 1932 and of the H6C in 1933. Its replacement was the T68 or J12, which was powered by V12 engine, displacing just over 9.4 litres. Today the H6 is still one of the most highly respected models of the vintage and post vintage era."

            "article": "The Mercedes-AMG Motorsport portfolio is expanding to include a new, highly attractive model: the Mercedes-AMG GT2 Edition W16. The comprehensive further development of the Mercedes-AMG GT2, unveiled at the end of 2022, combines the fundamental characteristics of the base model with technical and stylistic references to the current Mercedes-AMG F1 W16 E PERFORMANCE. Its outstanding power-to-weight ratio and numerous new aerodynamic components, such as the active louvres above the front wheels, a Push2Pass function and the integrated Drag Reduction System (DRS), make the GT2 Edition W16 the most powerful Mercedes-AMG Customer Racing car of all time.The limited edition model combines exceptional performance potential of up to 830 hp (610 kW) with an exclusive design. The close visual connection to the current Formula 1 car is underlined by the signature of a well-known name on the door sill: Kimi Antonelli. The current driver of the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team is the patron of the GT2 Edition W16, which is limited to 30 units. Designed for track day use, this collector's item will be delivered in an exclusive setting on a European racetrack, including a meet & greet with some of the best-known members of the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team.The Mercedes-AMG GT2 Edition W16 is not homologated. This means that it does not have to meet any racing series requirements or restrictions, allowing it to set new benchmarks for performance. Equipped with the striking 4.0-litre V8 biturbo from the base GT2 (707 hp/520 kW), the eight-cylinder engine has been optimised with new turbochargers and modified engine electronics. The result is a spectacular maximum output of 830 hp (610 kW). This makes the GT2 Edition W16 the most powerful GT vehicle ever built by Mercedes-AMG.The Mercedes-AMG GT2 Edition W16 reaches its peak performance when the Push2Pass function is activated, which is another extra feature compared to the base model. When the driver presses the corresponding button on the multifunction steering wheel, the system temporarily increases the boost pressure. This provides an additional 100 hp (73 kW) and 200 Newton metres of torque. The maximum torque thus rises to 1000 Nm and the maximum output of 830 hp is achieved. In terms of power-to-weight ratio, the special edition model boasts an impressive figure of around 1.7 kg/hp. Thanks to its consistent lightweight construction, the GT2 Edition W16 has a weight of just 1,430 kilograms. The newly designed magnesium rims, which feature colour accents that create a visual link to the Formula 1® car, also contribute to the weight optimisation.The Mercedes-AMG GT2 Edition W16's power is transmitted via a sequential six-speed racing transmission with modified gear ratios. As with all Mercedes-AMG GT racing cars, the transmission is mounted on the rear axle in a transaxle configuration and connected to the engine via a carbon fibre torque tube for torsional rigidity and high torque transmission. The suspension features fully adjustable four-way motorsport shock absorbers. In addition, the stabilisers on the front and rear axles can be adjusted in four stages to suit the respective requirements.To achieve optimum vehicle balance, Mercedes-AMG has further refined the aerodynamic concept of the GT2 model and fine-tuned it in numerous test drives on a range of Formula 1® circuits. The result is several new components: active louvres above the front wheels, an enlarged front diffuser, aerodynamically optimised exterior mirrors and a carbon spoiler lip integrated into the boot lid. Like the Formula 1® car, the GT2 Edition W16 also features a Drag Reduction System (DRS). This technology reduces drag, enabling the top speed to increase to over 320 km/h. By touching a button on the intuitive multifunction steering wheel, the DRS closes the louvres and folds the rear wing into a flat position. The Push2Pass function can also be activated simultaneously or separately at the touch of a button.The design of the Mercedes-AMG GT2 Edition W16 reflects its close ties to Formula 1®. The colour scheme and design elements carry the unmistakable hallmarks of the Mercedes-AMG F1 W16 E PERFORMANCE. A particularly striking feature is the hand-painted star pattern that wraps around the rear flanks of the edition model. The livery is completed by delicate emerald-green contrasting elements – the colour of the Mercedes F1 team's title partner PETRONAS.The exclusivity of the Mercedes-AMG GT2 Edition W16 continues in the interior. This starts with the door sill panels, which are hand-signed by Kimi Antonelli, one of the two current Mercedes-AMG F1 drivers. The young Italian, who also has valuable experience in GT Racing, is the renowned patron of the edition model. Its interior is dominated by matt carbon fibre surfaces. The seat, doors and centre console also feature accents in the PETRONAS colour. Compared to the GT2 base model, the CUBE CONTROLS steering wheel has been redesigned and its functionality improved. As a reference to the limited production run of the exclusive GT2 model, a ‘1 of 30’ badge is embedded in the centre console of each vehicle.Like the GT2 base model and all other Mercedes-AMG Customer Racing cars, the GT2 Edition W16 offers exemplary safety. Features include a carbon fibre safety cell connected to the chassis, a five-point harness, safety nets, a fire extinguishing system, a safety tank, and an emergency hatch. Other safety features include an effective racing ABS and a multi-adjustable traction control. Together with the precisely tuned suspension and very direct steering response, these elements help drivers to quickly build confidence in the vehicle when driving on the track.The ceremonial handover of the Mercedes-AMG GT2 Edition W16 is planned as part of an exclusive event at a European racetrack. In addition to an in-depth vehicle briefing and track time, the programme further includes a meet & greet with the drivers and senior members of the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team. Each of the 30 units of the strictly limited Mercedes-AMG GT2 Edition W16 comes with an edition-specific car cover and equipment from OMP and BELL Helmets, the Mercedes-AMG Motorsport Official Suppliers. The racing suit and racing helmet are each designed in the style of the official F1 team.“Formula 1® and GT Racing are the central pillars of Mercedes-AMG Motorsport. The Mercedes-AMG GT2 Edition W16 unites both worlds in one product. The limited edition model is our most powerful Customer Racing car to date and a spectacular race and track day vehicle in every respect. It combines fundamental characteristics of the Mercedes-AMG GT2 with stylistic and technical references from the Mercedes-AMG F1 W16 E PERFORMANCE. With the exclusive handover event, we are creating an unforgettable experience.” Christoph Sagemüller, Head of Mercedes-AMG Motorsport“I had the opportunity to test drive the Mercedes-AMG GT2 Edition W16 and had so much fun that I would have loved to spend more time on the track. The Push2Pass function is a truly sensational feature. The edition model is not only fast, but also safe. This immediately inspires confidence. I am very proud to be part of this project and to have my signature immortalised in every Mercedes-AMG GT2 Edition W16.” Kimi Antonelli, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team"

            "article": "YANGWANG, the luxury sub-brand of global new-energy vehicle (NEV) leader BYD, has set a new global production-car top-speed record of 496.22km/h (308.4 mph) at the ATP Automotive Testing Papenburg test track in Germany.The feat was achieved with YANGWANG’s latest U9 Xtreme hypercar on 14 September 2025, eclipsing its previous EV benchmark and the 490.484km/h (304.48 mph) maximum of the quickest petrol-powered model to become the world’s fastest car overall. This modern milestone in engineering sets a new standard in electric mobility, mixing unrivalled power and speed with zero emissions.Originally known as the U9 Track/Special Edition, and now officially confirmed as the YANGWANG U9 Xtreme in production guise, or U9X for short, the fastest car on the planet takes the existing technical architecture of the U9 currently on sale in China and harnesses the potential of a number of key evolutions.These include, but are not limited to: an upgraded powertrain with 1200V ultra-high-voltage electrics (compared with 800V), a lithium iron phosphate Blade Battery with a remarkable discharge rate of 30C, four ultra-high-speed motors that operate at up to 30,000rpm and produce a total of more than 3000PS, track-level semi-slick tyres, and revised DiSus-X suspension with specific tuning to cope with the increased stresses of circuit driving.BYD Executive Vice President Stella Li said: “This is an incredibly proud moment for everyone in the research and development division. YANGWANG is a brand that does not recognise the impossible, and only through this commitment to what’s coming next can you end up with a vehicle like the U9X. I extend my gratitude to the whole team, and my thanks to the driver, Marc Basseng, for his skill and technical input. It’s terrific that the fastest production car in the world is now electric.”The driver for the U9X’s record-breaking run was Marc Basseng, a German track specialist with a long history in sports-car racing and endurance motorsport. He said: “This record was only possible because the U9 Xtreme simply has incredible performance. Technically, something like this is not possible with a combustion engine. Thanks to the electric motor, the car is quiet, there are no load changes, and that allows me to focus even more on the track.”The U9 Xtreme is now being made available to customers, with a limited series production run of no more than 30 units. Its name is derived from the English word ‘Extreme’, meaning ‘limit’ and ‘ultimate’, with added emphasis on the ‘X’, which represents the unknown. These qualities fit perfectly with YANGWANG’s ethos of taking joy and delight from the act of exploration and the innovations that come through that process.By setting a new global speed record, YANGWANG redefines the sustainable hypercar. Backed by BYD's innovation and sustainability commitments, YANGWANG employs cutting-edge tech to deliver unmatched performance, safety, and driving experience."

            "article": "McLaren Automotive unveiled the 750S JC96 – a Japan-only limited-edition of the McLaren 750S that pays homage to the McLaren F1 GTRs that competed in the All-Japan Grand Touring Car Championship (JGTC), winning the Driver’s Championship in 1996.Additionally, the 750S JC96 celebrates McLaren’s legacy in Japan and its status as a luxury supercar brand admired for individuality and track-inspired performance. Just 61 cars will be available to customers, reflecting the race number of the Championship-winning car.The first McLaren limited-edition car to be offered only in Japan, the 750S JC96 is distinguished by its blend of unique paint in reference to the livery of the Team Goh F1 GTRs that competed in the 1996 JGTC campaign, alongside F1 GTR inspired interior features, plus a new Ultra-Lightweight 15-spoke forged alloy wheel. The car is available as a coupe or a Spider, marking the first application of the 750S MSO High Downforce Kit (HDK) on an open-top variant of the McLaren 750S.The F1 GTRs entered jointly by McLaren and Team Goh featured a distinctive ‘Tiger Stripe’ design blending the Rocket Pink and Tarmac Grey paintwork, and every 750S JC96 is offered with paint informed by the design of this livery. Unique details are applied to the Front Splitter, Rear Wing endplates, and Door Mirror Casings. These details are available in Memphis Red, Titanium Silver, Ice White and Graphite Grey; the four colours have been carefully chosen to combine with the wide palette of paints that 750S JC96 customers can choose from for the car body colour. Customers can also explore a unique paint for their car through the MSO Bespoke paint programme.The ultra-exclusive JC96 Tribute Livery takes these unique Tiger Stripe paint details further, across the whole vehicle body. It is a hand painted, full livery delivered by MSO, the option of which will be strictly limited to just four customer cars.“The 750S JC96 is our love letter to McLaren in Japan. Our Japanese clients demand track-inspired performance but without compromising on the tailor-made personalisation and attention to detail that truly makes a McLaren their McLaren. The 750S JC96 blends these demands perfectly, while offering for the first time the enhanced track performance of the MSO HDK with the sensations delivered by a benchmark beating convertible supercar for those who opt for a 750S JC96 Spider.” Henrik Wilhelmsmeyer, Chief Commercial Officer, McLaren Automotive.The 750S JC96 is distinguished by its adoption of the MSO High Downforce Kit (HDK) for 750S, which is now available on a 750S Spider for the very first time. Inspired by the first ever High Downforce Kit developed by McLaren for the F1 LM – and subsequently evolved and integrated into the 1996-specification F1 GTR – the HDK for 750S JC96 features a suite of components which work in harmony to increase aerodynamic performance; a revised front bumper housing the enlarged dual-element splitter, a Raised Active Rear Spoiler with integrated endplates, and a Louvred Under-wing Panel. In combination, the HDK delivers up to 10% additional downforce, enhancing track performance.Additional track influence is found in the new wheel debuting on the 750S JC96. The new Ultra-Lightweight ‘Delta’ 15-spoke forged alloy wheel is the first application of this design influenced by the race wheels of later-spec F1 GTRs, specifically the legendary ‘Longtail’ variants of the iconic racer, paired with F1 Gold red McLaren logo brake calipers. The Natural Titanium finish of the Central-exit Stainless Steel Sports Exhaust is another feature referencing GTR componentry.The legacy of the McLaren F1 GTR also lends inspiration to the bespoke interior of the 750S JC96. The Performance interiors – available in three variations of Full Alcantara® upholstery – all feature distinctive and unique features, tailor made to instil the spirit of the 1996 spec F1 GTR. Among the details, an F1-inspired pedal set, Drive Select switches, and a unique dedication plaque – all completed with a gold finish – will be fitted all 61 examples of the car alongside uniquely crafted JC96 branding on the headrests and armrests.The full standard specification of the 750S JC96 includes:750S MSO High Downforce Kit (HDK) including body coloured revised front bumper, Gloss Black enlarged carbon fibre front splitter, Gloss Black raised carbon fibre active rear spoiler, body colour underwing panel with Gloss Black louvresDelta 15-spoke Ultra-Lightweight Forged Allow Wheel in SilverF1 Gold Brake Calipers with Red McLaren LogoBody Colour Carbon Fibre Front Fenders with Gloss Black Carbon Fibre LouvresGloss Black Exterior Details PackPainted Details on Wing Endplates, Front Splitter, and Door Mirror Casings in a choice of Memphis Red, Ice White, Titanium Silver, Graphite GreyPainted JC96 BrandingCentral-exit Stainless Steel Sports Exhaust with Natural Titanium Exhaust FinisherGloss Black Roof with glazed C-pillarGloss Black Rear Bumper Lower & DiffuserMcLaren Vehicle Badging in Chrome FinishInteriorJC96 Performance full Alcantara® interior; Carbon Black with Carbon Black, Carbon Black with Bright Red Contrast Stitching, Dove Grey with Carbon BlackJC96 Embroidered Headrest BrandingF1-inspired Pedal Set in Gold Finish with JC96 BrandingJC96 Dedication Plaque in Gold finishGold finish Brightwork on Drive Select (DNR) SwitchesArmrest Branding with JC96 LogoSteering Wheel Clasp and Extended Metal Gearshift Paddles in Brushed Dark TitaniumBrightwork – Brushed Dark Titanium (Infotainment Surround, DNR Surround, Door Applique, Air Vent Bezels)12 Colour Interior Ambient LightingEngine Bay LightingAlcantara® Sill TrimIn addition to the MSO JC96 Tribute Livery, exclusive options for the 750S JC96 include JC96 Exterior Details, HDK & Underbody, and Front and Rear Louvres Carbon Fibre Packs, unique JC96 750S Side Badges, and JC96 Branding on the Rear Wing surface.All 750S JC96 customers will have the opportunity to curate a specification tailored to them through the intimate personalisation services offered by MSO. A list of MSO Bespoke options that can inspire further individual expression includes the MSO Interior Livery Theme Pack, which applies the signature JC96 Tiger Stripe Livery Pattern to the painted 12 O’clock marker and paddles, the Extended Carbon Fibre Door Sills, Interior Door Applique, and includes a Bespoke Painted Vehicle Key. Additionally, MSO offers F1 GTR Inspired Bespoke Painted Centre Caps for the Delta 15-Spoke Ultra-Lightweight Forged Alloy Wheels and Bespoke Painted Brake Calipers.Mounted in the front luggage compartment, the optional McLaren Track Record Plaque celebrates McLaren’s legacy on the racetrack. The titanium plaque is directly inspired by the concept first seen in the McLaren F1 road car. It honours the defining championship and race wins in McLaren’s history, and the iconic cars that achieved them.The 750S JC96 is fitted as standard with Pirelli P ZERO™ tyres, with even higher-performance Pirelli P ZERO™ Corsa and racetrack-focused Pirelli P ZERO™ Trofeo R tyres as options. All three tyres are engineered by McLaren and its exclusive tyre partner Pirelli, as are the Pirelli P ZERO™ Winter tyres available from McLaren retailers.The McLaren 750S has received widespread recognition for its benchmark beating levels of supercar performance and driver engagement. Powered by a mid-mounted, M840T 4.0-litre, twin-turbocharged V8 McLaren engine developing 750PS, its lightweight carbon fibre Monocage II central structure and Proactive Chassis Control III suspension system help to ensure that the 750S is the lightest and most agile car in its class."

Inspired by the first ever High Downforce Kit developed by McLaren for the F1 LM – and subsequently evolved and integrated into the 1996-specification F1 GTR – the HDK for 750S JC96 features a suite of components which work in harmony to increase aerodynamic performance; a revised front bumper housing the enlarged dual-element splitter, a Raised Active Rear Spoiler with integrated endplates, and a Louvred Under-wing Panel. In combination, the HDK delivers up to 10% additional downforce, enhancing track performance.Additional track influence is found in the new wheel debuting on the 750S JC96. The new Ultra-Lightweight ‘Delta’ 15-spoke forged alloy wheel is the first application of this design influenced by the race wheels of later-spec F1 GTRs, specifically the legendary ‘Longtail’ variants of the iconic racer, paired with F1 Gold red McLaren logo brake calipers. The Natural Titanium finish of the Central-exit Stainless Steel Sports Exhaust is another feature referencing GTR componentry.The legacy of the McLaren F1 GTR also lends inspiration to the bespoke interior of the 750S JC96. The Performance interiors – available in three variations of Full Alcantara® upholstery – all feature distinctive and unique features, tailor made to instil the spirit of the 1996 spec F1 GTR. Among the details, an F1-inspired pedal set, Drive Select switches, and a unique dedication plaque – all completed with a gold finish – will be fitted all 61 examples of the car alongside uniquely crafted JC96 branding on the headrests and armrests.The full standard specification of the 750S JC96 includes:750S MSO High Downforce Kit (HDK) including body coloured revised front bumper, Gloss Black enlarged carbon fibre front splitter, Gloss Black raised carbon fibre active rear spoiler, body colour underwing panel with Gloss Black louvresDelta 15-spoke Ultra-Lightweight Forged Allow Wheel in SilverF1 Gold Brake Calipers with Red McLaren LogoBody Colour Carbon Fibre Front Fenders with Gloss Black Carbon Fibre LouvresGloss Black Exterior Details PackPainted Details on Wing Endplates, Front Splitter, and Door Mirror Casings in a choice of Memphis Red, Ice White, Titanium Silver, Graphite GreyPainted JC96 BrandingCentral-exit Stainless Steel Sports Exhaust with Natural Titanium Exhaust FinisherGloss Black Roof with glazed C-pillarGloss Black Rear Bumper Lower & DiffuserMcLaren Vehicle Badging in Chrome FinishInteriorJC96 Performance full Alcantara® interior; Carbon Black with Carbon Black, Carbon Black with Bright Red Contrast Stitching, Dove Grey with Carbon BlackJC96 Embroidered Headrest BrandingF1-inspired Pedal Set in Gold Finish with JC96 BrandingJC96 Dedication Plaque in Gold finishGold finish Brightwork on Drive Select (DNR) SwitchesArmrest Branding with JC96 LogoSteering Wheel Clasp and Extended Metal Gearshift Paddles in Brushed Dark TitaniumBrightwork – Brushed Dark Titanium (Infotainment Surround, DNR Surround, Door Applique, Air Vent Bezels)12 Colour Interior Ambient LightingEngine Bay LightingAlcantara® Sill TrimIn addition to the MSO JC96 Tribute Livery, exclusive options for the 750S JC96 include JC96 Exterior Details, HDK & Underbody, and Front and Rear Louvres Carbon Fibre Packs, unique JC96 750S Side Badges, and JC96 Branding on the Rear Wing surface.All 750S JC96 customers will have the opportunity to curate a specification tailored to them through the intimate personalisation services offered by MSO.

Additionally, MSO offers F1 GTR Inspired Bespoke Painted Centre Caps for the Delta 15-Spoke Ultra-Lightweight Forged Alloy Wheels and Bespoke Painted Brake Calipers.Mounted in the front luggage compartment, the optional McLaren Track Record Plaque celebrates McLaren’s legacy on the racetrack. The titanium plaque is directly inspired by the concept first seen in the McLaren F1 road car. It honours the defining championship and race wins in McLaren’s history, and the iconic cars that achieved them.The 750S JC96 is fitted as standard with Pirelli P ZERO™ tyres, with even higher-performance Pirelli P ZERO™ Corsa and racetrack-focused Pirelli P ZERO™ Trofeo R tyres as options. All three tyres are engineered by McLaren and its exclusive tyre partner Pirelli, as are the Pirelli P ZERO™ Winter tyres available from McLaren retailers.The McLaren 750S has received widespread recognition for its benchmark beating levels of supercar performance and driver engagement. Powered by a mid-mounted, M840T 4.0-litre, twin-turbocharged V8 McLaren engine developing 750PS, its lightweight carbon fibre Monocage II central structure and Proactive Chassis Control III suspension system help to ensure that the 750S is the lightest and most agile car in its class."

            "article": "Ferrari has unveiled its latest sports car, the 849 Testarossa, to international press and clients. The car, which replaces the SF90 Stradale in the range, is a hybrid plug-in super sports berlinetta equipped with three electric motors alongside the mid-rear twin-turbo V8, delivering a total of 1050 cv, 50 more than the car it replaces.The 849 Testarossa takes its place at the top of Ferrari’s range thanks to its performance, its ability to thrill the driver without ever compromising ride comfort or interior refinement, as well as its futuristic yet deeply historically rooted design. This car is conceived for the most demanding clients; those who want the very best from a Ferrari. It is also the reason for the return of a legendary name in Maranello’s history, Testa Rossa, which was first used on the 500 TR in 1956 to describe the colour of the cam covers of some of Ferrari’s most extreme, high-performance and iconic racing engines, before being used as a name for one of the marque’s most famous road-going models, the 1984 Testarossa.The heart of the 849 Testarossa revolves around its twin-turbo eight-cylinder internal combustion engine, part of the family of engines that received multiple International Engine of the Year awards. The unit has been completely re-engineered to reach new performance peaks (a remarkable 830 cv of maximum power) and is combined with an advanced hybrid system derived from Ferrari’s unmatched motorsport experience. Among the most prominent innovations is the new turbo, the largest ever for a Ferrari production car, enabling unprecedented acceleration. The hybrid group, consisting of a rear electric motor and two units installed on the front axle, is capable of delivering 220 cv. The on-demand four-wheel drive system and torque vectoring maximize performance in all conditions.To enhance its dynamic qualities and the driver feedback at the limit, the 849 Testarossa is equipped (in addition to the latest generation brake-by-wire system) with Ferrari’s ABS Evo controller, which improves braking precision and consistency in all conditions, along with the new braking system. The spring and damper set-up has been completely revised for improved behaviour at the limit of grip. Extensive component weight reduction has allowed the 849 Testarossa to boast the best power-to-weight ratio ever for a range model, since the enormous performance increase has not resulted in any additional weight compared to the SF90 Stradale.From a styling point of view as well, the 849 Testarossa marks a revolution in the concept of a Ferrari V8 mid-rear berlinetta: the inspiration taken from 1970s Sports Prototypes, together with sharp and geometric lines, creates a unique and timeless design. The synergy between form and function has enabled impressive aerodynamic performance: the total downforce of 415 kg at 250 km/h represents a 25 kg increase over the SF90 Stradale as well as providing a 15% boost in cooling power for the powertrain and brakes.The cockpit is even more enveloping and ergonomic than before: the central sail motif with the integrated gear-change gate, inspired by the F80, improves the positioning of components and makes them more accessible. The new steering wheel, equipped with mechanical buttons (including the iconic engine start button), elevates the driving experience while maintaining the high functionality of the latest-generation Ferrari steering wheels. Finally, a new HMI system makes interaction with the car even simpler and more intuitive.The 849 Testarossa is equipped with a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) system consisting of the 830 cv twin-turbo V8 engine combined with three electric motors, a high-voltage battery, and an inverter that together deliver a total output of 220 cv. This system brings the total power of the powertrain up to 1050 cv, an absolute record for a production Ferrari. The architecture of the 849 Testarossa's plug-in hybrid powertrain has been designed to ensure maximum performance, vehicle dynamics, and usability.The 849 Testarossa’s internal combustion engine (project code F154FC) is the latest version of Ferrari’s multi-award-winning twin-turbo V8. It produces 830 cv with a specific output of 208 cv/l, marking a 50 cv increase compared to the previous iteration. This achievement was made while maintaining the same displacement and completely revising the components, including the all-new turbocharger, cylinder heads, engine block, exhaust manifolds, intake plenums, titanium fasteners, valve train system, and fuel rail.A new, larger turbocharger has been adopted with F80-derived low-friction bearings and an innovative heat shield on the turbine casing inspired by the 296 GT3 to improve thermal management in the engine compartment. The compressor wheels and the turbine have been optimized in terms of materials and aerodynamics, and a refined calibration strategy has been introduced, all to minimise turbo lag and maintain the responsiveness of the engine. The intercooler has been optimised in order to manage the increase in power and improve thermal efficiency.The increase in engine power was achieved without any significant weight penalty thanks to machining inspired by racing engines, lightening of the camshafts and the adoption of titanium screws, improving the weight/power ratio by almost 10% compared to the SF90 Stradale.The Inconel® exhaust manifold sees the diameter of the ducts increase by 20% and its length by 10% to improve the performance and provide the timbre typical of the Ferrari sound. The adoption of a flexible Inconel joint manages extremely high temperatures without increasing weight. The exhaust system integrates GPFs and a new generation ceramic matrix for the catalysers, which keep the layout unchanged while complying with regulatory requirements without any significant increase in mass.The 849 Testarossa, for the first time on a Prancing Horse range car, has also introduced the use of recycled aluminium secondary alloys for engine castings (cylinder head, crankcase and sump) reducing CO₂ emissions per kilogram of aluminium used by a maximum of 80%, which equates to a reduction of up to 0.4 ton of CO₂ equivalent per car.The 849 Testarossa adopts a PHEV architecture derived from the SF90 Stradale, combining the V8 internal combustion engine with three electric motors for a total power of 220 hp. Two of them are located on the front axle and make up the RAC-e (electronic cornering set-up regulator) system which enables the 4WD system and torque vectoring to maximise traction and efficiency when exiting corners. The third electric motor, the MGU-K (Motor Generator Unit, Kinetic), is positioned on the rear axle and derives directly from the Scuderia’s experience in Formula 1.The entire system has been revised to improve performance and driving comfort, with an optimised calibration to work in synergy with the internal-combustion engine. The control system also integrates a new active damping function aimed at regularizing the engine idle, improving the transition between the thermal and electrical operating phases. The cooling maps of the electric motors have been optimised, ensuring a higher thermal efficiency of 10-12 °C. This keeps the electric performance consistent for a longer period, even under conditions of intensive use.The regeneration strategy under braking has been revised to improve pedal feel even more, making pedal travel even smoother and more effective. The regenerative intervention is more progressive and natural, further improving the consistency between electrical and hydraulic deceleration. The battery and electric motor management strategies are calibrated according to the four electric driving modes that can be selected via the eManettino — eDrive, Hybrid, Performance and Qualify — optimising performance in all conditions. In eDrive mode, the car can travel up to 25 km in electric drive only thanks to the 7.45 kWh lithium-ion battery which is installed in the chassis to ensure a low centre of gravity and optimal weight balance.The 849 Testarossa introduces a new sonic dimension that reflects the essence of the car, with a powerful and pure character. The timbre of the new V8 turbo has been optimised to ensure a recognisable acoustic signature in all driving conditions, while preserving the distinctive harmonics of Ferrari’s V8.The sound level has been increased at all speeds, with particular attention to the richness and purity of the sound in the low and mid ranges. The goal was to enhance the bright tones of the noble orders of combustion (multiples of order 2) in acceleration. Moving up towards the limiter set at 8300 rpm, the power of the powertrain manifests itself explosively, with an immersive experience involving sound, acceleration and vibration, emphasized by the flat crankshaft architecture.The new gear shift strategy, inherited from the SF90 XX Stradale, has been revised to generate an even more exciting sound during upshifts in press-on driving. This effect has been achieved through a new engine calibration that works in synergy with the gearbox control logic, optimising the sequence of actuations and the pressure in the combustion chamber to maximise sound intensity during lift off. The content is active from medium loads and revs, returning the effect of a racing shift with a characteristic timbre of the engine on the over-run. The shifting becomes even more extreme from the 'Race' position of the Manettino forward."

            "article": "Ferrari has unveiled its latest sports car, the 849 Testarossa, to international press and clients. The car, which replaces the SF90 Stradale in the range, is a hybrid plug-in super sports berlinetta equipped with three electric motors alongside the mid-rear twin-turbo V8, delivering a total of 1050 cv, 50 more than the car it replaces.The 849 Testarossa takes its place at the top of Ferrari’s range thanks to its performance, its ability to thrill the driver without ever compromising ride comfort or interior refinement, as well as its futuristic yet deeply historically rooted design. This car is conceived for the most demanding clients; those who want the very best from a Ferrari. It is also the reason for the return of a legendary name in Maranello’s history, Testa Rossa, which was first used on the 500 TR in 1956 to describe the colour of the cam covers of some of Ferrari’s most extreme, high-performance and iconic racing engines, before being used as a name for one of the marque’s most famous road-going models, the 1984 Testarossa.The heart of the 849 Testarossa revolves around its twin-turbo eight-cylinder internal combustion engine, part of the family of engines that received multiple International Engine of the Year awards. The unit has been completely re-engineered to reach new performance peaks (a remarkable 830 cv of maximum power) and is combined with an advanced hybrid system derived from Ferrari’s unmatched motorsport experience. Among the most prominent innovations is the new turbo, the largest ever for a Ferrari production car, enabling unprecedented acceleration. The hybrid group, consisting of a rear electric motor and two units installed on the front axle, is capable of delivering 220 cv. The on-demand four-wheel drive system and torque vectoring maximize performance in all conditions.To enhance its dynamic qualities and the driver feedback at the limit, the 849 Testarossa is equipped (in addition to the latest generation brake-by-wire system) with Ferrari’s ABS Evo controller, which improves braking precision and consistency in all conditions, along with the new braking system. The spring and damper set-up has been completely revised for improved behaviour at the limit of grip. Extensive component weight reduction has allowed the 849 Testarossa to boast the best power-to-weight ratio ever for a range model, since the enormous performance increase has not resulted in any additional weight compared to the SF90 Stradale.From a styling point of view as well, the 849 Testarossa marks a revolution in the concept of a Ferrari V8 mid-rear berlinetta: the inspiration taken from 1970s Sports Prototypes, together with sharp and geometric lines, creates a unique and timeless design. The synergy between form and function has enabled impressive aerodynamic performance: the total downforce of 415 kg at 250 km/h represents a 25 kg increase over the SF90 Stradale as well as providing a 15% boost in cooling power for the powertrain and brakes.The cockpit is even more enveloping and ergonomic than before: the central sail motif with the integrated gear-change gate, inspired by the F80, improves the positioning of components and makes them more accessible. The new steering wheel, equipped with mechanical buttons (including the iconic engine start button), elevates the driving experience while maintaining the high functionality of the latest-generation Ferrari steering wheels. Finally, a new HMI system makes interaction with the car even simpler and more intuitive.The 849 Testarossa is equipped with a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) system consisting of the 830 cv twin-turbo V8 engine combined with three electric motors, a high-voltage battery, and an inverter that together deliver a total output of 220 cv. This system brings the total power of the powertrain up to 1050 cv, an absolute record for a production Ferrari. The architecture of the 849 Testarossa's plug-in hybrid powertrain has been designed to ensure maximum performance, vehicle dynamics, and usability.The 849 Testarossa’s internal combustion engine (project code F154FC) is the latest version of Ferrari’s multi-award-winning twin-turbo V8. It produces 830 cv with a specific output of 208 cv/l, marking a 50 cv increase compared to the previous iteration. This achievement was made while maintaining the same displacement and completely revising the components, including the all-new turbocharger, cylinder heads, engine block, exhaust manifolds, intake plenums, titanium fasteners, valve train system, and fuel rail.A new, larger turbocharger has been adopted with F80-derived low-friction bearings and an innovative heat shield on the turbine casing inspired by the 296 GT3 to improve thermal management in the engine compartment. The compressor wheels and the turbine have been optimized in terms of materials and aerodynamics, and a refined calibration strategy has been introduced, all to minimise turbo lag and maintain the responsiveness of the engine. The intercooler has been optimised in order to manage the increase in power and improve thermal efficiency.The increase in engine power was achieved without any significant weight penalty thanks to machining inspired by racing engines, lightening of the camshafts and the adoption of titanium screws, improving the weight/power ratio by almost 10% compared to the SF90 Stradale.The Inconel® exhaust manifold sees the diameter of the ducts increase by 20% and its length by 10% to improve the performance and provide the timbre typical of the Ferrari sound. The adoption of a flexible Inconel joint manages extremely high temperatures without increasing weight. The exhaust system integrates GPFs and a new generation ceramic matrix for the catalysers, which keep the layout unchanged while complying with regulatory requirements without any significant increase in mass.The 849 Testarossa, for the first time on a Prancing Horse range car, has also introduced the use of recycled aluminium secondary alloys for engine castings (cylinder head, crankcase and sump) reducing CO₂ emissions per kilogram of aluminium used by a maximum of 80%, which equates to a reduction of up to 0.4 ton of CO₂ equivalent per car.The 849 Testarossa adopts a PHEV architecture derived from the SF90 Stradale, combining the V8 internal combustion engine with three electric motors for a total power of 220 hp. Two of them are located on the front axle and make up the RAC-e (electronic cornering set-up regulator) system which enables the 4WD system and torque vectoring to maximise traction and efficiency when exiting corners. The third electric motor, the MGU-K (Motor Generator Unit, Kinetic), is positioned on the rear axle and derives directly from the Scuderia’s experience in Formula 1.The entire system has been revised to improve performance and driving comfort, with an optimised calibration to work in synergy with the internal-combustion engine. The control system also integrates a new active damping function aimed at regularizing the engine idle, improving the transition between the thermal and electrical operating phases. The cooling maps of the electric motors have been optimised, ensuring a higher thermal efficiency of 10-12 °C. This keeps the electric performance consistent for a longer period, even under conditions of intensive use.The regeneration strategy under braking has been revised to improve pedal feel even more, making pedal travel even smoother and more effective. The regenerative intervention is more progressive and natural, further improving the consistency between electrical and hydraulic deceleration. The battery and electric motor management strategies are calibrated according to the four electric driving modes that can be selected via the eManettino — eDrive, Hybrid, Performance and Qualify — optimising performance in all conditions. In eDrive mode, the car can travel up to 25 km in electric drive only thanks to the 7.45 kWh lithium-ion battery which is installed in the chassis to ensure a low centre of gravity and optimal weight balance.The 849 Testarossa introduces a new sonic dimension that reflects the essence of the car, with a powerful and pure character. The timbre of the new V8 turbo has been optimised to ensure a recognisable acoustic signature in all driving conditions, while preserving the distinctive harmonics of Ferrari’s V8.The sound level has been increased at all speeds, with particular attention to the richness and purity of the sound in the low and mid ranges. The goal was to enhance the bright tones of the noble orders of combustion (multiples of order 2) in acceleration. Moving up towards the limiter set at 8300 rpm, the power of the powertrain manifests itself explosively, with an immersive experience involving sound, acceleration and vibration, emphasized by the flat crankshaft architecture.The new gear shift strategy, inherited from the SF90 XX Stradale, has been revised to generate an even more exciting sound during upshifts in press-on driving. This effect has been achieved through a new engine calibration that works in synergy with the gearbox control logic, optimising the sequence of actuations and the pressure in the combustion chamber to maximise sound intensity during lift off. The content is active from medium loads and revs, returning the effect of a racing shift with a characteristic timbre of the engine on the over-run. The shifting becomes even more extreme from the 'Race' position of the Manettino forward."

            "article": "Porsche is presenting the top-of-the-range model of the 911 series at the IAA Mobility motor show in Munich: an innovative twin-turbo powertrain with T-Hybrid technology makes the new 911 Turbo S the most powerful production 911 to date.The new Porsche 911 Turbo S is following in big footsteps. Its predecessor was already considered the benchmark in the sports car world when it came to combining performance, long-distance comfort, exclusivity and everyday usability. Now, the 911 Turbo S has once again raised the bar significantly in all areas. The sports car, which is available as a coupé and cabriolet, debuts with significantly increased performance, a more powerful design, more intelligent aerodynamics, an optimized chassis and even more exclusive equipment.\"The 911 Turbo S is the most complete and versatile form of driving a Porsche 911. Whether in daily use, on long autobahn journeys or on the racetrack – we have made the new 911 Turbo S even more comfortable, more individual and significantly faster than its predecessor,\" says Frank Moser, Vice President of the 911 and 718 model line.The newly developed, high-performance powertrain achieves a system output of 523 kW (711 PS). This makes the new 911 Turbo S the most powerful production 911 to date. The maximum torque of the powertrain is 800 Nm and is available over an extremely wide range of 2,300 to 6,000 rpm. The power curve is also characterised by an unusually broad peak: between 6,500 and 7,000 crankshaft revolutions, the full power of 711 PS is available. Equipped with the innovative and particularly lightweight T-Hybrid technology with a 400 V system, it increases power by 61 PS compared to its predecessor.A T-Hybrid powertrain first debuted in 2024 in the 911 Carrera GTS. The technology has since been significantly further developed for use in the new 911 Turbo S. While a single electric exhaust gas turbocharger (eTurbo) is integrated into the T-Hybrid system in the GTS, two eTurbos are used in the new 911 Turbo S. The turbine and compressor were specifically designed to meet the requirements of the top-of-the-range model. The two eTurbos contribute not only to the considerable increase in performance, but also improve the responsiveness of the powertrain.The particularly compact lightweight high-voltage battery with a capacity of 1.9 kWh is the same as that used in the 911 Carrera GTS . An eight-speed PDK with an integrated electric motor transmits the power to the Porsche Traction Management (PTM) all-wheel drive system. The Turbo S Coupé's sprint time of 0-100 km/h is reduced by 0.2 seconds to 2.5 seconds compared to its predecessor. It takes just 8.4 seconds to reach 200 km/h, which represents an improvement of 0.5 seconds. The top speed of the new 911 Turbo S is 322 km/h.Despite the additional components of the performance hybrid system, the new 911 Turbo S weighs just 85 kilograms more than its predecessor. The increase in weight has been more than compensated for in all areas relevant to driving dynamics. The best demonstration of this is the lap time on the Nürburgring Nordschleife. As part of the final development drives conducted in autumn 2024, a lightly camouflaged 911 Turbo S achieved a time of 7:03.92 minutes under notarial supervision – around 14 seconds faster than its predecessor. \"You don't feel the weight gain. On the contrary – the car is much more agile, has more grip and is significantly faster than its predecessor in all relevant sections of the track,\" says Porsche Brand Ambassador Jörg Bergmeister, who was involved in the development and testing of the new 911 Turbo S and set the official lap time.Porsche’s engineers implemented upgrades across all areas to achieve the impressive performance of the top-of-the-range 911 model. The new generation of tyres used in the 911 Turbo S offers significantly improved dry handling while maintaining good performance in the wet. The rear axle of the sports car is now fitted with 10 millimetres wider tyres compared to the previous model, measuring 325/30 ZR 21. As with its predecessor 255/35 ZR 20 size tires are mounted on the front axle. The standard Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake (PCCB) system is fitted with new brake pads and can withstand enormous loads. This improves braking performance and pedal feel in equal measure. The engineers increased the brake disc diameter on the rear axle from 390 mm to 410 mm. Brake discs with a diameter of 420 mm are used at the front. This means that the new 911 Turbo S is equipped with the largest PCCB brake system that Porsche has ever installed in a two-door model.Enhanced aerodynamics optimise the cooling and efficiency of the new 911 Turbo S. Active, vertically arranged cooling air flaps at the front of the vehicle and an active front diffuser, together with an adjustable front spoiler lip and the extendable and tilting rear wing carried over from the predecessor, work together as an efficient overall system. Cooling air flows optimally to the brakes and radiators. Depending on the driving situation, the active aerodynamics intelligently reduce lift or, when retracted, drag. The drag coefficient of the 911 Turbo S Coupé has been reduced by 10 per cent compared to its predecessor, when all active aerodynamic elements are in their most efficient position. In addition, the active aerodynamics improve the wet braking performance of the top model: in wet mode, the front diffusers close to shield the front brake discs from excessive water spray.The T-Hybrid powertrain with its high-voltage electrical system and battery system allows Porsche engineers to equip the 911 Turbo S with electro-hydraulically controlled Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (ehPDCC) as standard. It reduces the tendency to roll when changing direction and increases agility when entering and exiting corners. The system works with cross-connected, active coupling rods, in which pressure is built up by oil volume flow depending on the driving situation. The stabilizers generate support forces and keep the vehicle in balance. This makes the sports car even more predictable and easier to drive despite the enormous power. This improves both driving comfort and driving dynamics. As a result, the top model of the 911 model series improves further in driving comfort, stability and agility at the same time. For optimum everyday usability, the electrohydraulic PDCC is available with an optional lift system for the front axle, which acts much faster than its predecessor thanks to its integration into the 400 V system.A new standard sports exhaust system with rear silencer and tailpipe trims made of titanium also underscores the position of the 911 Turbo S acoustically. Its sound was composed especially for the top model. In addition, the exhaust system saves 6.8 kg of weight. Internal engine modifications are another factor contributing to the even more emotive sound. The 3.6-litre boxer engine works specifically with asymmetrical timing that adds further frequencies to the engine, creating a more throaty and distinctive sound typical of a boxer engine.The new Turbo S marks the introduction of Porsche's cross-series Turbo design strategy in the 911. Numerous contrasting elements are finished in the colour Turbonite, which is reserved exclusively for Turbo variants. These include the Porsche crest and the Turbo S lettering at the rear. In addition, Turbo S-specific inserts in the slats of the rear wing and the side window strips differentiate the top-of-the-range model. The range of wheels for the Turbo S includes new centre-lock designs in Turbonite.As is typical for the Turbo, the new top-of-the-range model of the current 911 series has a visibly wider body and track compared to the Carrera models, as well as openings in the rear side section. On the redesigned rear fascia, striking ventilation openings additionally emphasise the width. The tailpipes of the titanium exhaust system in a newly interpreted design typical of the Turbo underscore the car's position in the model line, as does a dynamic pearl structure above the taillight strip. Oval titanium tailpipe trims with a special structure are available as an option. Overall, its exclusive appearance clearly differentiates the Turbo S from other 911 models.Turbonite accents also characterise the interior. They can be found in the door panels, on the steering wheel, dashboard and centre console surrounds, as decorative stitching, and on the Sport Chrono stopwatch and instrument cluster. Porsche’s designers have also used the colour for the seat belts and several buttons in the center console. For the first time, carbon-structured trim strips with neodyme trim and a perforated microfiber headliner with black backing are part of the exclusive interior.As a coupé, the 911 Turbo S is delivered as a two-seater as standard. On request, the rear seat system can be configured at no extra charge. The cabriolet is delivered in a 2+2 configuration. Porsche equips the new 911 Turbo S with HD Matrix LED headlights as standard. They feature innovative light functions that increase safety noticeably when driving at night. The Sport Chrono Package including tyre temperature gauge, the specifically tuned PASM suspension, the PDCC electro-hydraulic roll support and the titanium sports exhaust system are also standard equipment. In the interior, Adaptive 18-way Sports Seats Plus with memory function and \"turbo S\" lettering on the headrests are used ex works. The Turbo S-specific embossing on the seat surfaces and door panels is a reinterpretation of the design features of the first 911 Turbo 930. The folding lightweight sports bucket seat familiar from the 911 GT3 is available as an option for the coupé.Further customisation options are available via the Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur range. In addition to the Paint to Sample programme with more than 100 exterior colours, these options include Turbo Exclusive Design wheels with carbon blades painted in Neodyme, a lightweight roof in visible carbon, Exclusive Design rear lights and air intakes in the rear side section made of carbon. For the first time, lightweight wiper arms made of carbon, which are 50 per cent lighter than the standard component, can be ordered. The interior can be further enhanced with details such as decorative stitching in contrasting colours, personalised embossing, seat consoles and sill panels in leather with fine decorative stitching, as well as personalised painted vehicle keys."

Whether in daily use, on long autobahn journeys or on the racetrack – we have made the new 911 Turbo S even more comfortable, more individual and significantly faster than its predecessor,\" says Frank Moser, Vice President of the 911 and 718 model line.The newly developed, high-performance powertrain achieves a system output of 523 kW (711 PS). This makes the new 911 Turbo S the most powerful production 911 to date. The maximum torque of the powertrain is 800 Nm and is available over an extremely wide range of 2,300 to 6,000 rpm. The power curve is also characterised by an unusually broad peak: between 6,500 and 7,000 crankshaft revolutions, the full power of 711 PS is available. Equipped with the innovative and particularly lightweight T-Hybrid technology with a 400 V system, it increases power by 61 PS compared to its predecessor.A T-Hybrid powertrain first debuted in 2024 in the 911 Carrera GTS. The technology has since been significantly further developed for use in the new 911 Turbo S. While a single electric exhaust gas turbocharger (eTurbo) is integrated into the T-Hybrid system in the GTS, two eTurbos are used in the new 911 Turbo S. The turbine and compressor were specifically designed to meet the requirements of the top-of-the-range model. The two eTurbos contribute not only to the considerable increase in performance, but also improve the responsiveness of the powertrain.The particularly compact lightweight high-voltage battery with a capacity of 1.9 kWh is the same as that used in the 911 Carrera GTS . An eight-speed PDK with an integrated electric motor transmits the power to the Porsche Traction Management (PTM) all-wheel drive system. The Turbo S Coupé's sprint time of 0-100 km/h is reduced by 0.2 seconds to 2.5 seconds compared to its predecessor. It takes just 8.4 seconds to reach 200 km/h, which represents an improvement of 0.5 seconds. The top speed of the new 911 Turbo S is 322 km/h.Despite the additional components of the performance hybrid system, the new 911 Turbo S weighs just 85 kilograms more than its predecessor. The increase in weight has been more than compensated for in all areas relevant to driving dynamics. The best demonstration of this is the lap time on the Nürburgring Nordschleife. As part of the final development drives conducted in autumn 2024, a lightly camouflaged 911 Turbo S achieved a time of 7:03.92 minutes under notarial supervision – around 14 seconds faster than its predecessor. \"You don't feel the weight gain. On the contrary – the car is much more agile, has more grip and is significantly faster than its predecessor in all relevant sections of the track,\" says Porsche Brand Ambassador Jörg Bergmeister, who was involved in the development and testing of the new 911 Turbo S and set the official lap time.Porsche’s engineers implemented upgrades across all areas to achieve the impressive performance of the top-of-the-range 911 model. The new generation of tyres used in the 911 Turbo S offers significantly improved dry handling while maintaining good performance in the wet. The rear axle of the sports car is now fitted with 10 millimetres wider tyres compared to the previous model, measuring 325/30 ZR 21. As with its predecessor 255/35 ZR 20 size tires are mounted on the front axle. The standard Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake (PCCB) system is fitted with new brake pads and can withstand enormous loads. This improves braking performance and pedal feel in equal measure. The engineers increased the brake disc diameter on the rear axle from 390 mm to 410 mm. Brake discs with a diameter of 420 mm are used at the front. This means that the new 911 Turbo S is equipped with the largest PCCB brake system that Porsche has ever installed in a two-door model.Enhanced aerodynamics optimise the cooling and efficiency of the new 911 Turbo S. Active, vertically arranged cooling air flaps at the front of the vehicle and an active front diffuser, together with an adjustable front spoiler lip and the extendable and tilting rear wing carried over from the predecessor, work together as an efficient overall system. Cooling air flows optimally to the brakes and radiators. Depending on the driving situation, the active aerodynamics intelligently reduce lift or, when retracted, drag. The drag coefficient of the 911 Turbo S Coupé has been reduced by 10 per cent compared to its predecessor, when all active aerodynamic elements are in their most efficient position. In addition, the active aerodynamics improve the wet braking performance of the top model: in wet mode, the front diffusers close to shield the front brake discs from excessive water spray.The T-Hybrid powertrain with its high-voltage electrical system and battery system allows Porsche engineers to equip the 911 Turbo S with electro-hydraulically controlled Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (ehPDCC) as standard. It reduces the tendency to roll when changing direction and increases agility when entering and exiting corners. The system works with cross-connected, active coupling rods, in which pressure is built up by oil volume flow depending on the driving situation. The stabilizers generate support forces and keep the vehicle in balance. This makes the sports car even more predictable and easier to drive despite the enormous power. This improves both driving comfort and driving dynamics. As a result, the top model of the 911 model series improves further in driving comfort, stability and agility at the same time. For optimum everyday usability, the electrohydraulic PDCC is available with an optional lift system for the front axle, which acts much faster than its predecessor thanks to its integration into the 400 V system.A new standard sports exhaust system with rear silencer and tailpipe trims made of titanium also underscores the position of the 911 Turbo S acoustically. Its sound was composed especially for the top model. In addition, the exhaust system saves 6.8 kg of weight. Internal engine modifications are another factor contributing to the even more emotive sound. The 3.6-litre boxer engine works specifically with asymmetrical timing that adds further frequencies to the engine, creating a more throaty and distinctive sound typical of a boxer engine.The new Turbo S marks the introduction of Porsche's cross-series Turbo design strategy in the 911. Numerous contrasting elements are finished in the colour Turbonite, which is reserved exclusively for Turbo variants. These include the Porsche crest and the Turbo S lettering at the rear. In addition, Turbo S-specific inserts in the slats of the rear wing and the side window strips differentiate the top-of-the-range model. The range of wheels for the Turbo S includes new centre-lock designs in Turbonite.As is typical for the Turbo, the new top-of-the-range model of the current 911 series has a visibly wider body and track compared to the Carrera models, as well as openings in the rear side section. On the redesigned rear fascia, striking ventilation openings additionally emphasise the width. The tailpipes of the titanium exhaust system in a newly interpreted design typical of the Turbo underscore the car's position in the model line, as does a dynamic pearl structure above the taillight strip. Oval titanium tailpipe trims with a special structure are available as an option. Overall, its exclusive appearance clearly differentiates the Turbo S from other 911 models.Turbonite accents also characterise the interior. They can be found in the door panels, on the steering wheel, dashboard and centre console surrounds, as decorative stitching, and on the Sport Chrono stopwatch and instrument cluster. Porsche’s designers have also used the colour for the seat belts and several buttons in the center console. For the first time, carbon-structured trim strips with neodyme trim and a perforated microfiber headliner with black backing are part of the exclusive interior.As a coupé, the 911 Turbo S is delivered as a two-seater as standard. On request, the rear seat system can be configured at no extra charge. The cabriolet is delivered in a 2+2 configuration. Porsche equips the new 911 Turbo S with HD Matrix LED headlights as standard. They feature innovative light functions that increase safety noticeably when driving at night. The Sport Chrono Package including tyre temperature gauge, the specifically tuned PASM suspension, the PDCC electro-hydraulic roll support and the titanium sports exhaust system are also standard equipment. In the interior, Adaptive 18-way Sports Seats Plus with memory function and \"turbo S\" lettering on the headrests are used ex works. The Turbo S-specific embossing on the seat surfaces and door panels is a reinterpretation of the design features of the first 911 Turbo 930. The folding lightweight sports bucket seat familiar from the 911 GT3 is available as an option for the coupé.Further customisation options are available via the Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur range. In addition to the Paint to Sample programme with more than 100 exterior colours, these options include Turbo Exclusive Design wheels with carbon blades painted in Neodyme, a lightweight roof in visible carbon, Exclusive Design rear lights and air intakes in the rear side section made of carbon. For the first time, lightweight wiper arms made of carbon, which are 50 per cent lighter than the standard component, can be ordered. The interior can be further enhanced with details such as decorative stitching in contrasting colours, personalised embossing, seat consoles and sill panels in leather with fine decorative stitching, as well as personalised painted vehicle keys."

It showcases dual experiences with stunning looks and a refined interior that elevates the state-of-being for occupants (thus, Elevated), yet its lifted platform is calibrated for daring off-road performance in the most extreme desert locales (ergo, Velocity).Infused with technology that enables owners to roam without bounds, Elevated Velocity explores the artful integration of technology and design. This is exemplified by the various selectable user experience modes presented in the concept.Welcome Mode greets the driver – the vehicle floor, seats, instrument panel, doors and steering wheel illuminate in a soft white upon approach, while the dramatic exterior gull-wing doors lift skyward, inviting the occupants into the vehicle. A welcome animation on the steering wheel is reminiscent of shifting desert sand, while the Cadillac wordmark and V-Series logo illuminates on the dashboard endcaps.Elevate Mode is engaged by the driver. When engaged, Elevated Velocity becomes autonomous and the interior transforms into a recovery space for occupants. In Elevate Mode, the pedals and steering wheel retract, while the outside temperature, the driver’s body temperature and the cabin temperature are displayed to help optimize performance. Interior ambient lighting shifts to red, while the seatback lighting features infrared light to promote the optimal performance of the concept’s occupants. Doors are backlit to synchronize breathing and movement, furthering the emphasis on recovery. Above the steering column, a light moves forward and rearwards to aid in breathwork in conjunction with an animation displayed on the cowl to help the occupants get into the headspace for performance.Velocity Mode is engaged by the driver. When engaged, the interior lighting features cool white tones that evoke a sense of exhilaration. Door interiors are backlit, while white floor lighting dims to aid the driver in focusing on the road ahead and the deployable steering wheel displays speed, time, battery health and temperature and AR HUD navigation on the cowl display. In Velocity mode, the cockpit is the focus.Elevated Velocity embodies Cadillac’s V-Series performance and “Art of Exhilaration” design philosophy. It was designed with selectable driving modes that enable peak EV performance on any terrain and the maximum thrill of a Hypercar. Its lifted yet elegant design, riding on 24-inch wheels, enables occupants to chart the most challenging terrains, while providing a refined and luxurious on-road driving experience.Elevated Velocity’s selectable drive modes unlock the ability for drivers to experience precision on-road and power off-road, while a dual-mode drive adapts instantly to terrain and intent:e-Velocity Mode is ideal for intense on-road driving. It’s an evolution of Cadillac’s heart-pounding V-Mode found in V-Series vehicles today.Terra Mode enables peak off-road performance, activating air suspension.Sand Vision is a feature similar to Cadillac’s existing Night Vision technology, which enables the driver to achieve better visibility in a sandstorm.Elements Defy is a practical feature that keeps the exterior of Elevated Velocity clean of external elements and debris such as dust, sand, and dirt via a dust-phobic vibration, ensuring the vehicle arrives in pristine condition.On the exterior, Elevated Velocity balances capability with deliberate grace, whether an on-road jaunt or a challenging desert landscape. Elevated Velocity’s sleek profile optimizes aerodynamic efficiency, while its dramatic proportions and planted stance render a commanding presence.Elevated Velocity continues the elegant proportions Cadillac established with CELESTIQ and LYRIQ, such as its stretched hood, while pushing the brand’s design language forward. The concept explores a sculptural and technical balance that could serve as inspiration for potential future Cadillac production vehicles.The exterior expresses a sculptural prestige with an emphasis on speed integrating an efficient 2+2 cabin. It features a Vapor Blue exterior with undertones of flinty grey inspired by glacial ice, contrasting with the fiery red interior and further exemplifying the extreme performance nature of the concept. The blue storyline continues to the front and rear windshields and side glass, which sport a blue tint.Designed for easy entry and exit, gull-wing doors invite occupants into the vehicle, while the wheels feature a blend of flax fiber and black crystal tint acrylic. Cadillac’s signature Precision pattern is detailed throughout the concept.Additionally, the concept features a reimagination of Cadillac’s signature lighting choreography to complement the vehicle’s lifted stance, including elegantly fluted translucent front lighting, and rear vertical lighting with a unique light tunnel.Elevated Velocity’s cabin is thoughtfully equipped with elegant, purposeful features that enable an uncompromised lifestyle, equally refined and luxurious yet functional for all-road pursuits.Elevated Velocity was designed to elevate the state-of-being for its occupants. The colors, materials, and finishes in the cabin were intentionally selected for their aspirational form yet maximal functionality, contributing to the optimized occupant experience.The interior features layers of materials ranging from smooth wrapped surfaces, embossed grains, boucle fabric, tinted acrylic and glass, representing Elevated Velocity’s extreme capabilities with inspiration from desert polo pursuits.The cabin is outfitted in shades of deep red with brushed metal accents, suggesting the feeling of energy and movement:Morello Red: a deep red leather with smooth Fine Nappa grain outfitting the headliner/pillars, door uppers, seat cushions, rear compartment, cabin and cargo floorCerise: a sleek red fabric wrapping around the vehicle’s interior from the doors to behind the instrument panel, and behind the rear seats, creating a full ring of the material. The doors feature a unique 3D printed pattern in black crystal inspired by the dynamic action of desert polo – the clashing of mallets or motion of the horse’s hooves as they sprint across a field of shifting sand.Garnet: a red boucle fabric that adorns the seat uppers, door armrests, console armrest, and instrument panelWhen Elevate mode is selected, a variety of in-cabin experiences are engaged:Interior cabin filtration pulls dust particles out of the cabin air to keep the interior pristine“Extreme climatization” compensates for dry air, sudden and extreme temperature shifts, and altitude changesAir purification and air fragrance keeps occupants looking and feeling refreshedIntegrated red light therapy helps occupants recover from vigorous pursuitsThe well-appointed cabin features a vault locked compartment for critical items and the storage space required for an adrenaline-seeking lifestyle, illustrated by the bespoke polo set in the rear of the concept. The hand-crafted polo set echoes the aesthetic of Elevated Velocity, with the case reflecting the concept’s Vapor Blue exterior color. The polo helmet, gloves, kneepads and mallet are crafted in Morello red and feature Cadillac wordmarks, crests, and interpretations of the Cadillac precision pattern."

            "article": "Today, Chevrolet gave car enthusiasts and racing fans a glimpse of the high-performance future. Two Corvette concept cars, the Corvette CX and CX.R Vision Gran Turismo, debuted at The Quail, a Motorsports Gathering. While not intended for production, the pair will serve as inspiration to inform Corvette design language for years to come. Drawing on more than 70 years of performance innovation, these Corvette concepts honor the heritage of America’s sports car1 – and propel it into the future.The CX and CX.R Vision Gran Turismo are the latest and last of several Corvette concepts to be revealed this year, as part of a GM design exercise which involved multiple GM studios globally. The CX concepts were designed and fabricated at the Chevrolet Performance Studio in Warren, MI.“While the shape of a Corvette has always been expressive and forward-looking, each crease and line has its roots in the generations that came before it. It is aspirational, it is cultural, it is the reason people want to come and work at Chevrolet,” said Phil Zak, executive design director for Chevrolet. “The CX and CX.R Vision Gran Turismo demonstrate our design teams stepping away from the constraints of production vehicles and unleashing their creativity. Through this exercise, we’ve added to Corvette and defined the design direction for Corvette moving forward.”Imagine a future Corvette designed from the ground up to provide the ultimate high-performance driving experience on the open road or the racetrack. This was the inspiration behind the Corvette CX concept.The CX concept design starts with quintessential Corvette hallmarks. The forward-lunging nose, the pronounced horizontal “chine” line delineating the upper and lower bodywork, and the dual-element taillights are all signature features of Corvette models past and present. The proportions are long, low, and sleek, with a roofline less than 41 inches high.Aggressively futuristic, yet unquestionably a Corvette, the CX concept shows what an uncompromised future sports car can be. The athletic exterior design, highlighted by the fighter-jet-inspired cockpit canopy, isn’t just about looking powerful – it was shaped in collaboration with the GM Motorsports Aero Group. Every angle was designed with ultimate performance in mind.The innovations continue underneath the skin with the Vacuum Fan System. Built-in fans draw air through the open-channel bodywork, generating massive downforce and adjusting the airflow over the rear diffuser to refine aerodynamic balance in real-time. The front diffuser and rear wing are both active, adjusting automatically in response to the driver’s inputs to generate maximum grip. The integrated understructure of the CX concept is visible through the aero channels in the bodywork, and the suspension A-arms are wing-shaped to enhance airflow and reduce front-end lift.The CX concept’s propulsion system was chosen to provide maximum design freedom, plus ultimate straight-line performance to complement the corner carving enabled by fan-driven downforce and active aero.The CX concept is an all-wheel-drive electric supercar with a propulsion system worthy of the Corvette name. Four motors, one powering each wheel, generate more than 2,000 horsepower, with four-wheel torque vectoring for maximum grip and cornering performance. The 90-kWh lithium-ion battery is mounted in the chassis for a low center of gravity and ideal front-rear weight distribution.On the inside, every aspect of the CX concept was designed to provide an unmatched driving experience. The forward-opening fighter-jet-style canopy automatically raises as you approach. Driver and passenger settle into seating finished in Inferno Red ballistic textile, bolstered to help hold occupants in place during high-g cornering maneuvers. Premium silicone leather, milled aluminum, and low-gloss forged carbon fiber accents give an elevated feel to the driver-focused cabin.The digital windscreen transforms the windshield into an immersive surround display with real-time performance data. Every major control is elegantly integrated into the steering wheel, keeping the driver’s focus on the road ahead.For more than 25 years, the Corvette road car program has been accompanied by a championship-caliber Corvette Racing competition program. This close relationship between road car and racecar isn’t just a source of pride for Corvette fans – it helps further the technical learnings that can be shared across both realms. True to Chevrolet’s performance DNA, the design team created a Corvette CX concept exclusively for track competition. The CX.R Vision Gran Turismo imagines the future of Corvette GT racing – a future gamers will be able to drive in Gran Turismo 7.The CX.R VGT racecar embodies Corvette’s history while looking to the future of automotive performance. The familiar yellow and black color scheme honors the Corvette GT racecars of the past 25 years. Designers took CX’s athletic exterior and ramped up the aggression for CX.R VGT with more prominent active aero features and a lower ride height for racetrack-dominating downforce and grip. Weight has been reduced across the car to further emphasize the all-out focus on performance.Inside, the touring-inspired surfaces and materials of CX have been replaced by functional, high-performance appointments. The dashboard consists of lightweight raw carbon fiber weave, and the seating uses suede-wrapped foam inserts for grip and support where the driver needs it. The seats themselves have larger, much more aggressive shoulder and headrest pads to provide the head and neck support necessary with the intense handling capabilities CX.R VGT could deliver.Building off the propulsion template set by the Corvette CX concept, the CX.R VGT combines electrified performance with the thrill of a high-revving V8 engine. The mid-mounted 2.0-liter dual-overhead-cam twin-turbo V8 makes up to 900 horsepower and revs to 15,000 rpm.Powered by renewable e-fuel, this V8 drives the rear wheels through an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. Three electric motors – one for each front wheel, plus a third incorporated into the 8-speed gearbox – provide instant torque for jaw-dropping acceleration and contribute to a total system output of 2,000 hp.The Corvette CX and CX.R VGT aren’t just inspirational stage displays. In partnership with Chevrolet performance engineers, the Corvette design team created detailed blueprints for the chassis, drivetrain, and aerodynamic features of both the CX and CX.R VGT concepts. Working with Polyphony Digital Inc., a subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment, Chevrolet will make both the roadgoing CX and the CX.R VGT racecar concepts available for fans to drive virtually in Gran Turismo 7 later this month, giving new and familiar audiences a chance to experience firsthand the future of Corvette design."

            "article": "Gordon Murray Special Vehicles, the British manufacturer of SV Design, Heritage, and Bespoke sports and supercars has revealed its first two models – a pair of Le Mans tribute supercars – during Monterey Car Week in California.The new GMSV company redefines bespoke automotive craftsmanship, celebrates Gordon Murray’s heritage, and champions driver-centric visionary design. While sister company GMA focuses on premium, hand-built production cars, GMSV creates one-off commissions, limited-edition special designs and heritage-inspired continuations in response to sustained demand from enthusiasts, collectors, and visionaries seeking unique vehicles that transcend convention.The US global launch of newly created company ‘Gordon Murray Special Vehicles’ saw the presentation of new supercars from its ‘SV Design’ and ‘Bespoke’ product lines. Reflecting on Gordon’s love for endurance racing and his car’s emphatic 1995 Le Mans win, both vehicles take inspiration from one of the world’s greatest road races and deliver contemporary visions of the era’s racers.The sleek GMSV ‘Le Mans GTR’ draws on Murray’s own longtail Le Mans racers, adding inspiration from other great longtail cars of the 1970s, 80s, 90s. Icons like the Matra-Simca MS660, Porsche 917, and Alpha Romeo Tipo 33/3 contribute timeless characteristics, with performance-led aerodynamics and a distinctive SV Design language separating the new models from the purity of GMA’s supercars.Professor Gordon Murray, Group Executive Chairman: “Longtail racing cars perfectly combine aerodynamic benefit and aesthetic balance, I've always loved their mix of considered engineering and flowing design. Our Le Mans GTR timelessly reimagines the longtail racers I’ve admired since I began designing cars, adding contemporary aerodynamics and our exquisitely engineered chassis, engine, and transmission.”The new GMSV platform blends road going capability with track-inspired precision. For the Le Mans GTR GMSV utilises the high-revving GMA V12 engine and manual six-speed transmission, but changes almost every other element of the car. Every aspect of the new supercar is founded in Murray’s ethos of lightweight-led, engineering art with a road-going, yet track-inspired driving experience at the core of every design decision.Featuring enhanced Passive Boundary Layer Control, the sleek form enables low drag, while the aero-balanced front splitter, deep side skirts, and twin-channel rear diffuser generate maximum ground effect aerodynamics. Achieved without the need for the rear-mounted fan of T.50 and T.50s, the high-speed, high-grip package is enhanced further with the addition of a deep, full-width rear wing, delivering optimal balance of downforce and drag for road and track.Exiting between the twin-tunnel diffuser, the Le Mans GTR double exhaust is engineered to deliver a deep and balanced V12 soundtrack, while the roof-mounted ram-air intake adds to the orchestral cabin experience as owners explore the full 12,100 rpm rev range.For those opting to drive on circuits, the new SV Design model has stiffer and lighter suspension, a wider track, larger tyres (Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2), greater cooling, and optimised weight distribution. The Le Mans GTR gains larger air vents at the front and adds side-pod intakes ahead of the rear wheels for engine and gearbox cooling. To boost dynamics further, the Gordon Murray team innovated a solid engine mounting system that evades much of the noise and vibration issues commonly associated with solid mounting.Interior quality is retained despite the driving experience being far more track-focused than GMA’s halo T.50. All driver-focused components are newly designed with the entire dash, all switches and dials, seat cushioning, and pedal pads reimagined. Customers can specify materials and colours to honour iconic longtail racers from years past or work with the Creative design team to produce a highly personalised, modern cockpit.A limited series of just 24 GMSV Le Mans GTR supercars will be built, one for every hour of the famous race. Development is already underway with the first customer production cars set for completion in 2026. In collaboration with Joe Macari Performance Cars, GMSV paired each model with its owner. All Le Mans GTR supercars are sold, prices are undisclosed."

While sister company GMA focuses on premium, hand-built production cars, GMSV creates one-off commissions, limited-edition special designs and heritage-inspired continuations in response to sustained demand from enthusiasts, collectors, and visionaries seeking unique vehicles that transcend convention.The US global launch of newly created company ‘Gordon Murray Special Vehicles’ saw the presentation of new supercars from its ‘SV Design’ and ‘Bespoke’ product lines. Reflecting on Gordon’s love for endurance racing and his car’s emphatic 1995 Le Mans win, both vehicles take inspiration from one of the world’s greatest road races and deliver contemporary visions of the era’s racers.The GMSV S1 LM is the first ever commission executed by Gordon Murray Special Vehicles. As GMSV’s first vehicle, ‘S1’ denotes ‘Special One’, born from the customer’s passion for Gordon’s 1990s designs and his landmark 1995 win at Le Mans. The timeless design pays homage to the beauty of Murray’s original Le Mans-winning race car featuring prominent high-downforce aerodynamic elements. The primary focus of this project was to push the seven principles of Prof. Gordon Murray further than ever before with a particular emphasis on exclusivity, return to beauty, engineering art, lightweightness, and driving perfection.Professor Gordon Murray, Group Executive Chairman: “I love timeless design. I never want us to join the race to make the most outrageous looking supercar at expense of balance, beauty and proportion. Look at the result, the car is timeless and beautiful.”Its profile features a newly lowered roofline and every surface is completely new, made from ultra-lightweight carbon fibre body panels. The aero package is specific to S1 LM, with a front splitter, rear diffuser, and dual element rear wing that together deliver significant downforce and stability. At both ends, Le Mans-inspired lights feature precision-engineered housings that flow seamlessly with the LM’s sculpted bodywork.Building on Gordon Murray’s belief that the engine is the heart of the car and represents at least half of the experience, the S1 LM places its masterpiece at the very centre. The removal of the rear fan and oil cooling pack frees space to house a unique and exclusive 4.3-litre V12, producing over 700 PS – paired with a bespoke Inconel exhaust system, wrapped in 18-karat gold-foiled heat shielding. Engine development focused on larger displacement, lighter internals, and a higher compression ratio, maximising power, torque, and responsiveness. Capable of revving to 12,100 rpm, the V12 delivers a distinctive harmony through its four centrally mounted exhausts, inspired by the 1995 Le Mans–winning legend.The manual gearbox was developed using the T.50s casing with T.50 internals and optimised linkage and set-up to deliver short rifle-bolt throws. Suspension is bespoke, with new geometry, a lower ride height, and unique damper settings to deliver a sharp and highly connected driving experience. The innovative solid-mounted engine enables the purest expression of transient handling while minimising unwanted noise and vibration.The unique, race-inspired cockpit of the S1 LM is ergonomically designed around its central driving position, creating a fighter jet-style environment with minimalist, skeletal architecture, built on one of Gordon Murray’s seven principles: engineering art. The interior explores new lightweighting concepts, utilises the finest materials, and showcases bespoke craftsmanship at every touchpoint, delivering precision that embodies its motorsports pedigree.The Bespoke division of GMSV will build the client just five of these ultra-exclusive, road-legal S1 LM models for an undisclosed price, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2026."

            "article": "Automobili Lamborghini presents the Fenomeno, a few-off limited edition of just 29 cars that celebrates the brand’s heritage of exclusive models; new levels of performance and technical innovation; and iconic and essential design from Lamborghini Centro Stile, which 20 years ago presented the first car entirely designed by the recently-founded Sant’Agata Bolognese design department.The Fenomeno is an original Lamborghini ‘design manifesto’, taking the brand’s most representative stylistic elements to the extreme. In addition to the unique design and custom aerodynamics developed for the vehicle, the Fenomeno is equipped with the most powerful V12 in Lamborghini’s history, combined with three electric motors. The total power output is 1,080 CV, with a record 835 CV provided by the naturally aspirated V12 engine and a further 245 CV developed by the three electric motors. Fenomeno is defined by an extraordinary and unprecedented level of power, which the driver can fully exploit thanks to technical solutions incorporated for the first time on a Lamborghini, such as the 6D sensor and CCM-R Plus carbon-ceramic brakes.“When we presented the Reventón in 2007, our goal was to create a truly superlative super sports car that represented the ultimate expression of what Lamborghini stood for,” says Stephan Winkelmann, Chairman and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini. “This new few-off carries forward the same philosophy of distinction and innovation that is a fundamental part of our DNA.”A star of Monterey Car Week 2025, the Fenomeno is the ultimate expression of Lamborghini’s tradition of limited-edition vehicles. Starting with the Reventón, subsequent few-off models include the Sesto Elemento (2010), Veneno (2013), Centenario (2016), Sián (2019) and Countach (2021). The name Fenomeno comes, as per Lamborghini tradition, from a very brave and famous bull fought in Morelia, Mexico, in 2002. In a bullfight between two ‘toreros’, the bull was pardoned for the exceptional qualities it demonstrated. In both Italian and Spanish, Fenomeno means \"phenomenal,\" symbolizing something truly exceptional and unique.“Fenomeno is an extraordinary car in terms of performance, style and disruptive representation of Lamborghini, created to celebrate the value and achievements of our brand, and dedicated to those customers who expect the utmost exclusivity from us,” continued Winkelmann. “But beyond its extraordinary design and power, the Fenomeno is the few-off that, more than any other in Lamborghini's history, introduces innovative technical solutions to make the driving experience truly unique.”The powertrain is housed in the monofuselage, Lamborghini’s innovative aeronautics-inspired chassis, which as well as a monocoque made entirely of multi-technology carbon fiber, has a front structure in Forged Composite®, a special material made of short carbon fiber soaked in resin. This material has been produced and used by Lamborghini since the 2007 debut of the Reventón, the forerunner of all few-offs and a trailblazer thanks to its futuristic bodywork made entirely of carbon fiber.The Fenomeno is also equipped with technologies typically found in race cars, optimizing the car’s dynamics and delivering to the driver the best experience ever at the wheel of a V12. The CCM-R Plus brake system with carbon-ceramic discs guarantees maximum efficiency on both road and track. The single-nut forged rims contribute to delivering exceptional agility, while the special track-oriented tires custom-engineered by Bridgestone offer outstanding grip. Completing the Fenomeno is sport-tuned suspension, making the Fenomeno extremely precise and stable during sports driving. These characteristics, alongside the exceptional power, make the Fenomeno the fastest Lamborghini ever, both in the 0-100 km/h sprint – which it achieves in an extraordinary 2.4 seconds – and in the 0-200 km/h sprint, achieved in just 6.7 seconds. Maximum speed is over 350 km/h. The weight-to-power ratio is also the best in Lamborghini's history: 1.64 kg/CV."

            "article": "The inaugural creation of Solitaire – an expansion beyond even the highly bespoke world of Bugatti Sur Mesure – is Brouillard, a breathtaking Coupé that pays homage to Ettore Bugatti's beloved horse. Named after the faithful companion who could open his own stable door through a special mechanism designed by Ettore himself, this car celebrates the founder’s great love of horses, and his favorite horse of all. A majestic thoroughbred with a coat as white as the first snowfall, speckled with the subtle shades of a summer morning mist, Brouillard was no ordinary horse; he was the embodiment of everything Ettore admired: speed, beauty, and unparalleled grace. \"The Programme Solitaire allows us to authentically explore the unique visions of our clients, giving us more flexibility to explore different interpretations of long-established Bugatti design elements. On a one-of-one, we have much more freedom in the reinterpretation of what a Bugatti is, while maintaining the same absolute dedication to perfection in every detail; there will be no compromise to performance, quality or design. Each precious Solitaire will be unique and peerless, offering a level of attention to detail not found in even the most exclusive automotive creations.” Hendrik Malinowski, managing director of BugattiThe Programme Solitaire is inspired by Bugatti's coachbuilding roots, a tradition that flourished in the early 20th century when the most beautiful automotive bodies were created through collaboration between car companies and specialist coachbuilders. Jean Bugatti revolutionized this approach by bringing the craft in-house, enabling the creation of icons like the Type 57 SC Atlantic. Although that car may be most famous, the Type 57 chassis was adorned with numerous in-house bodies, including Galibier, Stelvio, Ventoux and Atalante, offering options from four-door saloon to two-door convertible and coupé.For the modern-day incarnation of this approach, Brouillard is built upon the pinnacle of Bugatti's W16-powered platform featuring the 1,600 PS iteration of the legendary quad-turbocharged engine. It represents the highest evolution of the W16 program, incorporating nearly two decades of engineering excellence and refinement.\"The bond between Ettore and Brouillard was deeply special. He saw in Brouillard a mirror of his own creations; the curves of the horse's body, the muscular flanks, the perfect proportions – these were all elements he tried to capture in the steel and aluminum of his cars. So here, the aesthetics of this car abstain from sharp lines in favor of more reflection-based surfaces that mimic a kind of athletic muscle, like a trained horse. It's heavily focused on sculptural surfaces and organic shapes, as the vision of a tendon underneath the skin. Enormous power and complexity, hidden by a veil of dignified simplicity.\" Frank Heyl, Bugatti design directorThe proportional mastery of Brouillard follows principles akin to classical art, where the relationship between elements creates immediate visual appeal. Through careful consideration of volume distribution, the lower third of the vehicle is rendered in dark tones that visually connect to the car's shadow. Much of the perception of a car comes from its upper two-thirds, helping in this case to create the perception of a lighter, more dynamic silhouette – appearing both lower and longer – while making the wheels appear proportionally larger.“To make something look simple is actually incredibly complex. The design has to integrate all of the technological aspects needed, all of the thermodynamics and aerodynamics of a 1,600hp hyper sports car, while also following a core ethos – established both by us and the client – that the Brouillard was imbued with dignity.” Frank HeylThe aerodynamic philosophy seamlessly integrates functional elements into the sculpted bodywork. Air intakes feed through radiators creating a pressure drop for more air flow through the radiators to optimize cooling efficiency, while the fixed ducktail wing provides aerodynamic balance and enhances the car's elegant silhouette. The rear diffuser maximizes the functional surface area through innovative exhaust packaging, representing the culmination of W16 platform development.Interior craftsmanship reaches new heights with the Brouillard, featuring an extraordinary combination of materials that celebrate both tradition and innovation. Custom-woven fabrics sourced from Paris incorporate tartan patterns, while green-tinted carbon fiber is paired with an increased number of machined aluminum components. The glass roof creates an airy, cathedral-like experience, while the center spine flows seamlessly from exterior to interior, visible through the transparent panel above.An absolute dedication to the finest artisan craftsmanship is evident in the Brouillard’s details, including embroidered horse motifs in the door panels and seat back rests. The seats themselves are customized and shaped to the owner’s preference, finished with a unique leather patch layout. The gear shifter is machined from a single block of aluminum and features a glass insert containing a miniature hand-crafted sculpture of Ettore’s favored horse and this car’s namesake. In every respect the Brouillard is a work of automotive haute couture, imbued with the limitless creativity of the entire Bugatti design, engineering and materials craftspeople.The commissioning owner of Brouillard is an enormously passionate Bugatti collector, not just of cars – both old and new – but also of the eclectic furniture of Carlo Bugatti and the beautiful bronze sculptures of Rembrandt Bugatti. The owner wanted to bring together all of the craft and artistry of the Bugatti family together in a masterpiece that celebrated a core inspiration of Ettore Bugatti’s approach to automotive design: his love of his horses. In these many bespoke details, the owner’s broad and detailed appreciation for Bugatti’s rich automotive history, the Bugatti family and Ettore’s unique bond with his favorite horse is celebrated.The Bugatti Brouillard will be officially unveiled during Monterey Car Week as the first project of the new Programme Solitaire. Each year, Solitaire will create a maximum of only two masterpieces, ensuring that each receives the complete attention and craftsmanship that it demands. Solitaire commissions will use existing Bugatti powertrains and chassis – just as Brouillard uses the 1,600hp W16 and latest corresponding carbon fiber and aluminum chassis – while focusing on bespoke bodywork and interior details."

            "article": "Porsche unveils the new 911 Cup – the latest evolution of its one-make cup racing car for the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup, the various Carrera Cup championships, and other Porsche-sanctioned series. This new model will line up on the grid from the start of the 2026 season. Based on the 992.2 generation of the 911, the latest edition of the acclaimed predecessor features numerous detailed refinements.Development efforts focused on enhancing performance, maintaining reasonable operating costs, and simplifying handling for both drivers and teams. The naturally aspirated 4.0-litre six-cylinder boxer engine now delivers an increased output of 382 kW (520 PS), a ten PS increase.The new racing car based on the 911 for Porsche’s one-make cups and series is now officially called the 911 Cup. With this, the Stuttgart-based sports car manufacturer is streamlining and standardising the naming of its customer racing vehicles. From now on, only cars intended for open-brand racing series or specific segments will carry the ‘GT’ suffix combined with a number in their designation, as is the case with the new evolution of the 911 GT3 R, which also makes its debut today. The 911 Cup is largely derived from the road-approved 911 GT models and is produced alongside the series-production cars at Porsche’s main plant in Zuffenhausen. This has proven highly successful: since production began at the end of 2020, Porsche Motorsport has built 1,130 units of the current 911 GT3 Cup. To date, a total of 5,381 Porsche 911 vehicles has been produced as one-make racing cars.“Like its successful predecessors, the new 911 Cup pushes boundaries. It combines series components from our GT sports cars with pure racing technology to create a coherent and performance-based overall concept,” emphasises Thomas Laudenbach, Vice President Porsche Motorsport. “Driving the 911 Cup has always been regarded as a challenge. And we want to keep it that way because it also serves as the training platform for our Porsche Juniors. The success of this concept is evident in its countless race and championship victories.”Michael Dreiser, Director Sales Porsche Motorsport: “The Cup race car based on the 911 is one of the best-selling racing cars in the world. Alongside the 718 GT4 RS Clubsport, it forms the demanding basis of our motorsport pyramid and is used globally in our one-make cup series. But its success extends far beyond that: the secret lies in its versatility. Cup cars regularly achieve strong overall results in endurance races, open GT competitions, and a myriad of other racing events.”The 911 Cup already sets itself apart visually from its predecessor, most notably with a front end that now reflects the design of the 992.2-generation 911 GT3. The front spoiler lip is now made up of three separate parts, allowing only the damaged sections to be replaced after contact, which also helps lower packaging and shipping costs for spare parts. The removal of the daytime running lights serves a similar purpose: in the event of a collision, they can no longer damage the radiators behind them, nor do they require replacement afterwards.The fenders feature integrated louvre vents, which aid airflow through the wheel arches and enhance aerodynamic downforce on the front axle. The same effect is achieved by the aerodynamically optimised underbody, which – like in the standard model – positively influences the car’s driving dynamics. So-called turning vanes, located behind the front wheel arches, further improve airflow along the front end. The interaction of these elements results in a more responsive front axle, particularly at high speeds, allowing the driver to position the race car with greater precision ahead of each corner.The more aggressively styled rear end of the new 911 Cup has undergone a complete redesign. The swan-neck rear wing features a revised connection to the wing supports, making position adjustment and handling easier. The engine compartment cover has also been thoroughly reworked. Like almost all body components – including the doors – it is made from recycled carbon fibre fleece combined with bio-based epoxy resin. For example, off-cuts from other manufacturing processes are repurposed to produce the fleece, a measure that contributes, among other benefits, to stabilising spare parts pricing."

            "article": "Porsche is set to launch a further refined version of the successful 911 GT3 R for the 2026 season. The new GT3 race car incorporates a range of detailed optimisations, including reworked aerodynamics.Since its debut at the start of 2023, the current Porsche 911 GT3 R has built an impressive track record, with numerous victories and titles from more than 500 race starts worldwide. In the past season alone, customer teams secured the unofficial GT3 World Championship for manufacturers in the Intercontinental GT Challenge and claimed first place in all three GTD Pro classifications of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.In the Nürburgring Langstrecken-Serie (NLS), the current GT3 R – of which Porsche Motorsport has delivered 106 units to customer teams to date – took the chequered flag first in six of the eight races on the legendary Nordschleife. The car also won the inaugural Endurance Trophy for LMGT3 teams and drivers in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC), including a class victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, triumphing over eight rival sports car manufacturers. This season, the up to 416 kW (565 PS) Porsche 911 GT3 R remained unbeaten at the French classic again. In the DTM, 2023 champion Thomas Preining reignited his 2025 title challenge with a recent victory at the Norisring.The newly evolved race car, refined by Porsche Motorsport in numerous key areas, now follows in the footsteps of its highly successful predecessor. The primary focus of the evolution was on optimising suspension and aerodynamics, with the goal of achieving an even more balanced handling and improved drivability – particularly for non-professional drivers – even under variable conditions.“Our focus for this update was on optimisation. Small changes can make a big difference when built on a solid, proven foundation,” says Sebastian Golz, Project Manager Porsche 911 GT3 R. “Driver feedback after the first race outing during the development phase in April confirmed our direction. We’re confident this evolution will allow our customer teams to continue competing successfully across the globe.”Michael Dreiser, Director Sales Porsche Motorsport, adds: “The Porsche 911 GT3 R’s record of more than 420 podium finishes says it all. It crowns our range of GT customer racing cars. Together with the 718 GT4 RS Clubsport, which represents the ideal entry point into international GT racing, this new evolution offers a strong overall package for the 2026 season. The option to upgrade existing 911 GT3 R models via an update kit also represents an attractive solution for our customer teams.”The most striking visual feature of the new 911 GT3 R is the addition of ventiducts on the upper side of the front wheel arches. These so-called “louvres” significantly contribute to improved aerodynamics. Coupled with the optimised kinematics of the double wishbone front suspension, which provides an anti-dive effect by enhancing force resistance, the louvres help to counteract front-end compression during deceleration, thereby maintaining aerodynamic balance. This reduces the tendency of the car to tilt forward during braking, also known as pitch sensitivity. As a result, the new 911 GT3 R offers more precise and predictable braking behaviour, improving overall control.At the rear, the swan-neck rear wing is equipped with a four-millimetre Gurney flap. This generates additional aerodynamic downforce and broadens the scope for aerodynamic balance adjustments. The underbody is fully enclosed and reinforced at the rear. Simultaneously, modified kinematics of the multi-link rear axle increase the anti-squat effect, reducing rear-end compression under hard acceleration. This improves dynamic load distribution between the axles. In combination with an adapted fifth-generation racing ABS from Bosch, these enhancements result in more balanced handling.Further detailed improvements are based on the extensive feedback from Porsche Motorsport’s customer teams across a wide range of racing events worldwide. For instance, the electrohydraulic power steering system now features additional fluid cooling, optimising its thermal performance and ensuring consistent steering forces, even on demanding circuits such as the Nürburgring Nordschleife. New ceramic wheel bearings enhance robustness and durability, while modified centring pins simplify the installation of drive shafts. These are now cooled directly via their own air supply through NACA ducts in the side skirts, independent of the brake cooling. This improves their stability on high-speed tracks such as Monza or Le Castellet, where low ride height is critical. At the same time, the rear brake cooling system can be adjusted more precisely – an important feature for circuits like Daytona.A modified driver air vent ensures consistent air circulation within the cockpit, even during long-distance races. The RLU USB stick now offers practical advantages: this Remote Logger Unit stores the driving data of the new 911 GT3 R directly on a USB stick, which can be quickly swapped out – even during a short pit stop. This eliminates the time-consuming need to connect a laptop via cable.Porsche Motorsport offers several former non-standard optional packages for the new 911 GT3 R ex-works: the sensor package, endurance package, pit lane link package, and camera package. These kits include four laser ride-height sensors, two master brake cylinder potentiometers, a track temperature sensor, a rear-view camera, and mountings for the water bottle system. A refuelling detection sensor registers when the fuel nozzle is inserted. Together with an additional refuelling LED, this plays a key role in series such as IMSA and the FIA World Endurance Championship, as well as in the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, to ensure compliance with minimum refuelling times and energy quantities.Customer teams can still choose from a range of special equipment options that are tailored to the demands of specific GT3 series. For the FIA LMGT3 class and IMSA, for example, these include special driveshafts and, in the NLS, a modified pre-silencer similar to the LMGT3, as well as wing supports with a modified adjustment range.The 4.2-litre flat-six engine, which delivers up to 416 kW (565 PS) depending on its Balance of Performance (BoP) classification, and the drivetrain of the current 911 GT3 R remain largely unchanged. For existing vehicles based on the 911 generation 992, Porsche Motorsport plans to offer around 60 update kits at a unit price starting at 41,500 Euros plus country-specific sales tax. The new-generation modifications can then be installed on existing vehicles.Development of the new 911 GT3 R began in August 2024. Porsche Motorsport conducted testing both at its in-house facility in Weissach and on permanent race circuits such as Sebring, Paul Ricard, Spa-Francorchamps, and the Nürburgring Nordschleife. A key test took place in mid-April under competitive conditions, when a test vehicle entered by Herberth Motorsport competed in the Michelin 12H Spa-Francorchamps on the Belgian Grand Prix circuit. Former Porsche Junior and reigning IMSA GTD Pro champion Laurin Heinrich, along with his German compatriots Ralf Bohn and Alfred Renauer, secured second place overall in the two-part race."

            "article": "Lamborghini has reaffirmed its commitment to international motorsport and today launches the new Temerario GT3, the very first race car derived from the Temerario road model. The Temerario GT3, which will compete in race series around the world, sets a new standard for the company’s competition cars and is the first to be entirely designed, developed and built at the Sant’Agata Bolognese factory in Italy. Conceived from the outset with a motorsport derivative in mind, the Temerario project has allowed for strategic integration of race-oriented engineering from the earliest design stages.As a result of this innovative approach by Lamborghini, the GT3 features an adapted version of the aluminum spaceframe chassis, specifically modified to meet the structural and serviceability requirements of racing. It is powered by the same 4-liter V8 twin-turbo engine as the Temerario production model, which has been re-engineered specifically in the area of forced induction, with redesigned turbocharging components to comply with GT3 regulations and deliver peak performance under race conditions.“The Temerario GT3 is the first racing derivative of the Temerario project, further emphasizing Lamborghini’s strong commitment to motorsport as a key tool for promoting our brand,” stated Stephan Winkelmann, Lamborghini Chairman and CEO. “Following the sporting and commercial success of the Huracán GT3 project, with which we won 96 championships and sold over 200 units, we have always envisioned racing derivatives from the very inception of the Temerario project. The Temerario GT3 will set a benchmark for its competitors, just as the road-going Temerario has.”“The Temerario GT3 has been designed with the end user in mind,” said Lamborghini Chief Technical Officer, Rouven Mohr. “Everything has been considered, from the efficiency of the aerodynamics to the power curve to the way in which the team is able to operate the car. The car operates in a slightly different area of the performance windows, that are used to balance the cars of different configuration, compared to its predecessor. We are confident that it will be competitive in terms of lap time, while also rewarding to drive in a wide range of conditions, including at night and in the rain. The development team has worked hard to ensure the car has a wide operating window, and that the teams are better able to work on it.”All aspects of the Temerario GT3 have been carefully optimized for competition while the design team has also retained the essence of the production car. The project draws on the experience of Lamborghini’s motorsport department with the Huracán GT3, which has achieved 96 titles worldwide in GT3 competitions over the past ten years.The aluminum spaceframe has been taken from the Temerario production line and converted for racing use through extensive lightweighting and simplification. In particular, the frame has been simplified to allow for quick removal and reattachment of the front and rear subframes during trackside operations. The removable rear subframe has been specially developed by Squadra Corse to accommodate the components of the engine and the new transmission, while all unnecessary brackets, which in the production car support the hybrid components, have been removed as they are not present in this racing version. In the central part of the aluminum frame a roll cage has been integrated, complying with FIA GT3 safety standards. The front subframe has also been modified, with removal of the electric motors that characterize the production car.Mounted on the chassis is new bodywork made from carbon composite material for the first time, to reduce the base weight of the car as far as possible. The bodywork is the result of a collaborative effort between the aerodynamics team at Squadra Corse and the Lamborghini Centro Stile. The aim was to maintain the production car's unmistakable style while adapting it to the requirements of the new engine and brake cooling system, achieving the desired performance targets for downforce and drag to ensure optimal aerodynamic balance.Additionally, the bodywork has been engineered for quick disassembly and reassembly during race weekends, to reduce time on pit road in case of repair. The front and rear ends of the bodywork are each constructed from a single piece. The rear diffuser, engine cover and bonnet have also been designed for rapid removal. Even the front lights feature a quick connector system for quick disassembly. The floor comes in four separate parts including two sections ahead of the front axle - one through the center of the car - and a powerful rear diffuser. The center section has been designed so that it can, if necessary, be changed while the car is on its air jacks in the pit lane.The refuelling system has been updated to increase the flow rate into the tank, while the tank design has been changed, enabling a new fuel sensor to be used to provide more accurate readings to the team. The aerodynamics have been optimized to improve the stability of the car under braking and reduce balance shift through cornering. With temperature management in mind, airflow to the radiators has also been improved as has the front radiator design, with efficiency of paramount importance. The removal of the hybrid unit from the engine has in turn increased demand on the turbochargers, which require greater airflow to maintain control of their temperature.Power comes from the production-derived 4-liter, V8 twin-turbo engine that has been developed by Lamborghini engineers with a new turbocharger and compressor unit. This is due to the car meeting international GT3 regulations which do not permit hybrid systems. In doing so, Lamborghini has changed the way in which the engine delivers the 550 hp (subject to balance of performance) instead of 800 hp as in the road engine.The powertrain of the road vehicle was developed by Lamborghini's R&D engineers with a design architecture explicitly oriented towards potential motorsport integration from the initial concept phase, including state-of-the-art engineering solutions such as the flat-plane crankshaft with a 180-degree angle between the crankpins. This crankshaft, typically used in racing engines, ensures optimal fluid dynamic behavior due to even firing orders compared to the cross-plane crankshaft, along with a uniquely engaging sound. Titanium conrods reduce the rotating masses and offer excellent material properties in terms of strength and lightness, reducing weight.The twin-turbo combustion engine is paired with a six-speed transverse gearbox. The airbox has been redesigned to meet the new requirements of the smaller turbochargers used in the race version, differing from those found in the road-going model. The engine has been completely recalibrated to deliver maximum performance across a broader rev range. Development of the vehicle was carried out using Pertamina Fastron Lubricants racing motor oil. The exhaust system is a custom solution developed specifically for the Temerario GT3 and is supplied by Capristo.The new model features a longer wheelbase compared to its predecessor, and a wider track front and rear, with the aim of improving stability in cornering. For the first time, the suspension features new 6-way dampers from KW, which is also the supplier for the SC63 LMDh project. The mounting points of the suspension no longer require carbon inserts in the chassis, but instead use mounting plates. The new suspension can also be changed quickly in the pits, saving time during the practice sessions by enabling fast changes to the basic setup. Tires are mounted on 18-inch wheels supplied by Ronal AG. The Temerario GT3 also features a custom hydraulic steering rack designed to achieve optimal suspension geometry and maximize performance with products from all the leading tire manufacturers to ensure that it remains competitive across the full range of championships around the world.The driver experience has been engineered with the support of Lamborghini factory drivers Marco Mapelli and Andrea Caldarelli, whose insights have been fundamental in refining ergonomics, control layout and usability during high-performance driving. In the cockpit, the electronics have been updated to improve the driver experience. The integration of state-of-the-art hardware has enabled the development of dedicated software, customized directly by Lamborghini to ensure optimal vehicle control. The switchgear in the cockpit is new, featuring updated graphics, and a more complete data logger. The steering wheel has been designed by Lamborghini based on customized specifications, incorporating feedback from its factory and customer drivers.The Temerario GT3 has been developed to be competitive with all relevant makes of tires and GT3 regulations and aims to serve the needs of Lamborghini’s customer teams, who require an increasingly refined and raceable product. The development phase will conclude during the 2026 season when the car will debut in a series of selected events, with the maiden outing planned for the Sebring 12 Hours in March. Lamborghini also remains committed to providing technical support to all customer teams still racing with the Huracán in the upcoming season during this transition phase."

            "article": "The covers have finally been removed from the new Lanzante 95-59, as the central highlight of the company’s Goodwood Festival of Speed celebrations, marking 30 years since claiming outright victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 3-seat bespoke project is the distillation of three decades of lessons learned, knowledge and expertise, and will provide access to an exclusive club; putting the driver at the centre. 95-59 is true to the very meaning of ‘driver focused’.Taking its name from an enviable history, 95-59 explains the story of where this latest Lanzante project started out; the year Lanzante claimed its famous victory at Le Mans and the race number of the winning car.Designed from the outset as a genuine three-seater, capable of extended cruising with luggage space, 95-59 is a step change in design, driven by obsession at every step. The final design, engineering practices and technologies used throughout 95-59 represent the latest in innovation, and every decision has been made with the driver as the main focus. Extensive ergonomic, technical and engineering evaluations combine with the lessons learned by the team responsible for some of the most extreme and exclusive automotive projects. The end result will be one of the most exciting modern-day drivers’ cars.“95-59 is the result of everything I personally and we, as a business, have learned and experienced over three decades since winning Le Mans,” explained Dean Lanzante.The bespoke project is presented at Goodwood for the first time as a production-intent styling concept, with its full carbon fibre body finished in Ueno Grey – matched to the exact shade of the 1995 Le Mans winner. At its core, 95-59 is based on a current McLaren platform, using a carefully re-engineered example of the carbon fibre chassis. This proven architecture provides the strength and versatility required, supporting the adaptation to comfortably accommodate three occupants. Within the newly designed and driver-centric cockpit, a lightweight moveable central seat is flanked by two outer passenger seats, integrated into the redesigned chassis. Power will be in excess of 850bhp with 880Nm of torque, delivered from a revised 4.0-litre V8 twin turbo engine combined with a seven-speed SSG transmission.“95-59 has a very natural balance to it. By its very design, with the driver as the focal point, it works as a piece of design, with symmetry and very natural forms,” explains Chief Designer, Paul Howse. “The design is a continuing development of my design theory, based on the efficiencies of organic shapes, and we have worked hard to deliver something that pushes the boundaries. Like the famous win 30 years ago, 95-59 is something that has not been seen or done before. However, working closely with Dean and the team at every stage, we have developed a design which stays true to the ethos of everything Lanzante has become known for over the past three decades.”With a target weight of just 1,250kg, 95-59 is presented in its lightest and most distilled configuration, with the optional ‘LM30 Pack’. This enhancement delivers a power to weight figure of 700bhp per tonne, positioning 95-59 within an exclusive group of supercars. The LM30 Pack combines to save around 20kgs in weight. It includes super-lightweight forged aluminium wheels, Inconel exhaust headers, titanium secondary and tailpipes, titanium body fixings, and gold-plated heat-shielding throughout the engine bay and exhaust, used for its superior heat protection. Subtle ‘LM30’ badging identify the pack from the exterior, while an embossed map of the Circuit de la Sarthe on the driver seat headrest, and scrutineer-style chassis plaque act as a reminder to where the project was born.Lanzante first delivered a road-going project in 1997, with the conversion of a McLaren F1 GTR to road use for a customer. That customer is still part of the Lanzante family to this day, and has been a part of the 95-59 journey since the outset. From that first road conversion project, Lanzante has created beautifully designed and crafted models for the most discerning car collectors and enthusiasts. The team, led by Dean Lanzante, has established a proven track record for the design and build of tailored commissions based on some of the world’s most iconic supercars.The project started out as the ultimate tribute to the history of the Le Mans victory.Close discussions and feedback from such a valued client base, which includes previous and current owners of 3-seat models as well as a range of the latest super and hypercars, has proven invaluable in the way the project has evolved. With a connection to where Lanzante has come from, this important group share the vision and obsession which Lanzante has become renowned for. It is through and with these clients that 95-59 has been formed.As the project has gathered momentum, it has become the most focused expression of the Lanzante brand. It is designed to connect drivers in a way that no other car does. Purity, perfected through obsession.“Crossing the finish line at Le Mans was actually the start of this journey to where Lanzante is now, and we are always looking to push boundaries and perceptions,” explains Dean. “Our projects regularly require us to answer the questions that others have either not wanted to ask, or have avoided, and I am proud to keep asking the questions to push what is possible.” “The original brief of ‘Project 95-59’ was to create something accessible and useable, for drivers. Three seats, luggage space, enhanced range; something drivers could, and wanted, to use. We wanted to deliver the same enjoyment and passion of buying and owning a classic car but in a contemporary way. Full focus on what the driver needs and wants, with a blend of modern technologies but pared back to maintain driver focus.”"

            "article": "A sculpted profile, a light soul, a distinctive character. This is the Huayra Codalunga Speedster: an open-air interpretation of the coupé version that won the Design Award at the 2023 Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Created by the Pagani Grandi Complicazioni division, the project was sketched by Horacio Pagani as a tribute to clients seeking the perfect balance between elegant forms and powerful performance. Only ten examples will be built, fully homologated for road use worldwide, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2026.“Every Pagani is born to bring into form the unique vision each person has of a Hypercar. For some, it must be extreme, bold, and able to captivate at first glance; for others, it embodies elegance, restraint, and harmony. From these different interpretations arise studies, research, and solutions that lead to strikingly distinct results, yet always recognizable by the Pagani signature: the purity of the lines, the absolute attention to every detail, and the balance between aesthetics and function. The Huayra Codalunga Speedster is a tribute to those who imagine their sports car as an icon of lightness and momentum, shaped by essential lines that transcend time with ease.” (Horacio Pagani, Founder & Chief Designer, Pagani Automobili)“In the 1950s and ’60s, racing cars could merge performance and beauty in an almost poetic balance. They had to be fast, but also light, sleek, and designed with meticulous attention to detail. Romantic lines, timeless. Then something changed. Efficiency started to overshadow elegance. With the Huayra Codalunga Speedster, we wanted to go back there. To that era of refined speed. We removed aerodynamic appendages and side air intakes. We pursued clean, tapered forms designed to cut through the air quietly, without unnecessary noise. A different kind of Pagani, built around an idea of visual and formal lightness.” (Lorenzo Kerkoc, Head of Grandi Complicazioni)The Huayra Codalunga Speedster inherits the stylistic codes of the coupé but reinterprets them decisively. It immediately stands out from any other open-top Pagani: even more streamlined, even purer. Starting with its structure, featuring an entirely new monocoque.The visual journey begins at the front. The headlights are embedded into the bodywork like light engravings. The bumper with integrated splitter channels air with millimetric precision. The lower, softer windshield flows into the car’s profile, making it slimmer and more harmonious.The side windows, inspired by post-war racing prototypes, have a lower shape and a gently rounded rear edge. This choice accentuates the tapered lines and fully embodies the speedster philosophy, conveying a sense of lightness and forward motion. The rear window extends this rhythm toward the panoramic hard top — a completely new element that, when mounted, creates a continuous line from the windshield to the tail. Viewed from above, the roof evokes the perfect shape of a drop, emphasized by the side pillars. The transparent section, made of polycarbonate, reduces weight without compromising rigidity.Along the sides, every line guides the eye. The doors, with traditional opening, are a coherent choice in keeping with the philosophy of essentiality. The aerodynamic blade is integrated. The external sills are sculpted in continuity with the doors and rear hood. No visible openings: air is channeled through hidden naca ducts in the flat underbody.Between the roof and the tail, the roll bar takes shape. It’s not just a safety arch — it’s a visual statement. It echoes the body color and carries it into the cabin, creating a cascading effect through the central tunnel, gear lever, and dashboard. A chromatic thread that connects exterior and interior, technique and poetry.The rear hood further accentuates the car’s streamlined tail. The bumper integrates a diffuser and two aerodynamic fins. The taillights appear suspended, as if floating in the air: pure light, pure lightness. The new six-outlet exhaust system, with lower titanium pipes and upper ceramic-coated outlets, completes the technical and aesthetic signature.Every line of the Huayra Codalunga Speedster is born from a desire to optimize airflow. CFD simulations refined the curvature of the wheel arches and the fluidity of the hood, ensuring a balanced distribution of aerodynamic load between the axles. The result? Less drag, better performance."

            "article": "Aston Martin is proud to announce the arrival of the new Vantage S – the most performance focused Vantage in Aston Martin’s sports car range. With the already thrilling, driver-focused Vantage firmly established as the class leading front-engine sports car, Vantage S builds on its position with increased power and even greater dynamic prowess. Together with distinctive exterior and interior enhancements, Vantage S establishes a new benchmark for Aston Martin’s acclaimed front-engine sports car range.Subsequent to the recently launched DBX S, Vantage S is the next step in the revival of Aston Martin’s long tradition of applying the ‘S’ suffix to special, high-performance derivatives of core models. A convention that began with Vanquish S which made its public debut at the Paris Motor Show in 2004, followed by the exceptional V8 and V12 Vantage S models launched in 2011 and 2013 respectively.Aston Martin CEO, Adrian Hallmark, said, “For many decades the illustrious Vantage nameplate has stood for the very best in performance, excitement and driving thrills. Those qualities were very much at the forefront when the new Vantage was launched to global acclaim last year. Exceeding those qualities was the challenge and motivation behind the new Vantage S. The result is a new benchmark in the front-engined ultra-luxury sports car sector; a car to excite Aston Martin’s passionate and discerning customers, and a vivid demonstration of the talent, scope and drive which exists within the marque today.”Central to the Vantage S is an upgraded version of the formidable Aston Martin 4.0-litre V8 Twin-Turbo engine. Extending Aston Martin’s performance advantage in the front-engine luxury sports car sector, the Vantage S now boasts 680PS at 6000rpm, with peak torque of 800Nm delivered between 3000 and 6000rpm for immediate in-gear response.Further enhancing driver engagement and performance feel, Aston Martin engineers have continued to refine and calibrate the throttle pedal weight and response aligned with ‘S’ characteristics. By offering a resistance matched to a drive-by-wire throttle map bespoke to ‘S’, and tuned for each of the Drive Modes, Vantage S delivers an even greater sense of connection with all controls working in harmony.Calibration changes have also been made to the powertrain, with optimisation of the Launch Control system resulting in a 0.1 second improvement in 0-60mph time, which is now just 3.3 seconds (0-62mph 3.4 seconds) and 0-124mph (200km/h) in 10.1 seconds. Top speed remains unchanged at a blistering 202mph.Vantage S also benefits from an extensive suite of detail changes to the new Vantage suspension hardware, powertrain mounts and control software to bring greater agility along with improvements in feel, driver engagement and composure.While Aston Martin’s chassis engineers were determined to extract more agility and front-end grip from the Vantage platform, they were also focused on ensuring those advances didn’t come at the expense of compliance and refinement.Hardware tuning and software calibration changes to the Bilstein DTX adaptive dampers have brought increased front-end feel and response, while rear spring aid stiffness has been reduced to balance compression and rebound for improved low speed ride quality. A 10% reduction in transmission mount stiffness brings in additional refinement by controlling the powertrain movement to the body and chassis, allowing the vehicle to breathe in harmony with the road.Further gains in directness and steering connection have been achieved by directly mounting the rear subframe to the body instead of rubber bushes. Finally, to maximise the compound benefits of these hardware and software changes, the suspension’s camber, toe and caster settings have been finessed to sharpen response, improve front-end grip under high lateral loadings and precisely dial-in the overall dynamic balance. The result is a car which has a thrilling appetite for corners backed up by steadfast stability.Visually, Vantage S has the looks to match its performance prowess thanks to distinctive features that combine immaculate design form with true performance-enhancing function.At the front, the new Vantage S is identified by new centrally mounted bonnet blades. Finished in gloss black or 2x2 Twill Carbon Fibre, not only do these vents provide a more assertive design character but they optimise the extraction of hot air from the ‘hot-V’ configured V8 engine.Model designation is restricted to discreet yet striking ‘S’ signature badging on the front fenders. Each one hand-made, the brass forged ‘S’ is a true piece of automotive jewellery; the ‘S ‘infilled in red glass enamel with the badge surround chrome plated in either bright or dark chrome to match the colour of the Aston Martin wings specified by the customer.Ensuring Vantage S is as instantly recognisable from the rear as the front, a full width decklid spoiler is the most explicit indicator of the marques sharpened performance focus. Not only for visual design assertiveness, the new rear spoiler increases rear downforce by 44kg at Vmax, contributing significantly to the overall 111kg of downforce at Vmax. The new spoiler has been used to tune the aerodynamics of the Vantage S, adding stability while ensuring the overall balance of downforce is biased towards the front-end to generate exceptional turn-in response and sustain a high level of cornering grip. Further updates to the underbody make up the additional 67kg of downforce at Vmax, including the addition of a new front airdam and front venturi vanes.Vantage S is also available to specify with a bespoke 21\" Y-spoke wheel in satin black with a red wheel graphic, continuing to tie in the red detailing synonymous with the ‘S’ marque, elegantly paired with a contrasting bronze painted brake calliper.Vantage S continues with bespoke ‘S’ cues inside the car, with a unique Alcantara® and leather ‘Accelerate’ interior as standard with satin 2x2 twill carbon fibre trim inlays. Maximising its sporting appearance and offering a modest weight saving over Vantage, this interior perfectly captures the essence of ‘S’.Just as the exterior badging embodies handmade craftsmanship, the interior of Vantage S is proudly adorned with colour matched, embroidered ‘S’ logos to the upper shoulder panel of the seats. With almost 2,500 individual stitches and over 16 metres of thread, each ‘S’ leaves no doubt to the commitment of total luxury and performance in every Aston Martin S model.Complementing the ‘S’ suffix, the iconic Aston Martin wings are also embroidered onto the headrests. An industry-first technique using both embossing and debossing is also an option available to customers, applying extreme pressure (1.5 tonnes) and heat to sculpt the wings into the leather with impeccable precision, creating a subtle but beautiful detail. In addition, the ‘S’ moniker appears on both the treadplates and engine bay final inspection plaque.Vantage S also offers customers a unique interior option package to further highlight its kudos as the most sporting of all Vantage models; a choice of red or silver anodised finish to the knurled metal drive mode rotary, creating a bold centrepiece to the cabin. The rotary is colour matched to the seatbelt, contrast welt, contrast stitch and headrest embroidery to create a flow of cohesive highlights throughout.For customers wishing to immerse themselves in even more luxury, Inspire Sport interior is available with either full semi-aniline leather or semi-aniline leather and Alcantara®, in both monotone and duotone options. These all-new interiors feature diminishing chevron quilting, surrounded by placed perforations, giving an unmistakeable impression of speed.Marking its global dynamic debut, Vantage S will be seen charging up the famous hill climb at the 2025 Goodwood Festival of Speed this weekend. Held at the Goodwood estate every July, The Festival of Speed is a highlight of the British summer season, drawing motorsport enthusiasts from around the globe.Vantage S is available to order now, alongside Vantage, in both Coupe and Roadster, with first deliveries expected in Q4 2025."

            "article": "Bentley Motors presents its latest luxury vision concept inside its brand-new design studio, which also officially opens its doors for the first time this week. EXP 15 represents Bentley’s design vision for the future, by taking inspiration from its early 20th century Grand Tourer heritage and interpreting it in a thoroughly modern 21st century way.Accordingly, the five-metre-plus full-size physical exterior model has an iconic upright grille, long ‘endless’ bonnet and rearward cabin reminiscent of the 1930 Bentley Speed Six Gurney Nutting Sportsman coupe, often known as the “Blue Train”. This famous Bentley from history is associated with a race between Woolf Barnato – then company chairman and renowned “Bentley Boy” – and a luxury express train (Le Train Bleu) from Cannes in the south of France to Calais in the north, arriving in London before the train had even got to Calais. But in combination with ultra-modern exterior surfacing, high-tech lighting details and active aerodynamic elements, the 2025 concept roots itself firmly in the now and future. While not intended for production or indeed sale, EXP 15 also provides hints to the design of future Bentleys including the brand’s first fully electric car due soon.Within its cabin, the design approach is just as forward-thinking. Created using virtual reality (VR) software to enable customers to see and experience a wider variety of possible configurations, it mixes familiar contemporary physical car interior features like luxury seating, wing-shaped dashboard, steering wheel, dials and switches with spellbindingly futuristic digital elements that can be brought to the fore or melt away into the background as driver mood or functional need requires.The package is unusual for featuring three seats and three doors – rather than four or five of both – to afford greater luxury in transit for the special few and includes innovative in-cabin storage for treasured pets and/or hand luggage as well. When stationary even the boot space can take on a dual role as upmarket picnic seating.Material choices are meticulous throughout and feature a mix of the traditional, artisanal and sustainable, combined with the ultra-modern, technical and futuristic. For example, a 100 per cent wool textile by Fox Brothers – the inventors of thorn-proof cloth and English weavers of some 250 years’ standing – is used in a damson ombre effect on EXP 15’s interior and can be found nestling in harmony with various lightweight 3D-printed titanium finishes.The user experience (UX) is also key to EXP 15 with the car designed to act as an intelligent and thoughtful mix of a fabulous conductor and celebrated chef all rolled into one.Robin Page, Bentley Director of Design, said: “The beauty of a concept car is not just to position our new design language, but to test where the market’s going. It’s clear that SUVs are a growing segment and we understand the GT market – through four generations of the Continental GT – but the trickiest segment is the sedan because it’s changing. Some customers want a classic ‘three-box’ sedan shape, others a ‘one-box’ design, and others again something more elevated. So this was a chance for us to talk to people and get a feeling.”The EXP 15 concept embodies the five exterior design principles for Bentley that will influence its future production cars. The first principle is ‘Upright Elegance’ and expresses the idea that all the fronts of Bentley cars – in silhouette – should display a very gently curved vertical line, akin to the upper body of a thoroughbred horse, just after it has that walked forward and come to a confident stop.Looking directly at the car from ‘front-on’, the second key exterior design principle is the ‘Iconic Grille’ which despite the changes to electrified powertrains is important to the brand’s historic visual architecture especially with a vertical line at its centre, as Director of Design, Robin Page continued: “Grilles used to be all about getting air to the combustion engine through the front of the car. But now with light technology changing we have an opportunity to create a piece of digital art. So the grille stays as our iconic front.”The third exterior design principle Bentley’s designers have identified is the ‘Endless Bonnet Line’ reflecting a heritage and back catalogue where a large combustion engine needed to be accommodated underneath. This line continues unbroken under the side windows and right back to the rear pillar of the car in a similar way to the historic 1930 Bentley Gurney Nutting coupe. With future powertrains turning electric and less space needed for them, spare space under the EXP 15’s bonnet is repurposed into two elegant storage solutions, accessed via twin panels which again reference the Gurney Nutting coupe, this time its piano-style hinged engine covers.The fourth exterior design principle – ‘Resting Beast’ – is best understood from the side and above. “All the finest Bentleys feature rear haunches that bulge outward from the body of the car above the rear wheels, expressing their ‘muscle’ and potent energy, just like the rounded shape of the bent upper legs of a big cat,” explains Domen Rucigaj, Head of Exterior Design. “But a Bentley’s overall stance needs to be relaxed and horizontal, not aggressively leaning forward (nor leaning back and looking ‘lazy’). I am also focused on perfect Bentley proportions which are divided, from top to bottom, into one third for the cabin and two-thirds for the body.”The fifth and final key exterior design principle is dubbed ‘Prestigious Shield’ and on EXP 15 relates to the large and clean surface at the rear of the concept, which on heritage Bentleys like the Gurney Nutting coupe were luggage sections separate to the body – but which on EXP 15 is part of the tailgate, upon which the new winged Bentley emblem proudly sits, framed by diamond-patterned rear lights.The surfacing of EXP 15’s bodywork over these proportions also reflects the new way modern Bentleys will be sculpted. Page and his team identified three key traits: ‘Monolithic Presence’ – to give the visual expression that elements of the car appear to be cut from a single block of stone; ‘Muscular Form’ – creating tensioned surfaces that visually indicate potential power, like an athlete’s body after an intensive training programme; and ‘Carved Precision’ – which is about reducing visual weight to ensure a clear and exact surface while keeping a sense of solidity.Beyond the proportions and surfacing of EXP 15, its exterior is accented by many delightful details, both functional and aesthetic. The front headlights are made up of four ultra-slim strips towards the car’s sides – the top two vertical and the bottom two kinked inwards – and positioned just inside the wheel arches to help define the car’s edges. These lights also frame the large front grille, where a central light spine descending from just below the Winged B emblem separates the grille’s two halves and features a horizontal interpretation of Bentley’s famous diamond quilt seat design, repeated here to recall the pattern of an historic grille, but rendered with modern LED lights instead.On each flank, just behind the front wheel arch, a pair of chunky vents help channel airflow, visually break up the body mass and provide graphic interest. Moving to the rear, more slim lights frame the large ‘Prestigious Shield’ surface and protrude for aerodynamic benefit while also revealing a pleasing 3D depth and another intricate interpretation of the diamond pattern in the process. Further aerodynamic elements include twin active spoilers that deploy from the end of the car’s rear-sloping roofline and an active aero diffuser at the car’s rearmost lower lip.The designers of the futuristic cabin of EXP 15 also gained influence from the inside of the 1930 Speed Six Gurney Nutting Sportsman coupe, in seating number and function, if not layout and form. Darren Day, Head of Interior Design shed light on the story and thinking his team used on EXP 15’s package: “Bentley’s then chairman Woolf Barnato had a Speed Six four-door Weymann fabric saloon by H J Mulliner, which he used to race the Blue Train in 1930. Meanwhile, he had a unique one-of-one Speed Six coupe being built, with a body by Gurney Nutting. Even though the coupe wasn’t finished when the race took place, it’s that car that’s become associated with it and has since become an iconic Bentley. What we were influenced by is the idea of a three-seat car with a unique window line and super slick proportions used for grand tours.”In keeping with that spirit, EXP 15 also offers a three-seat layout. One door on the driver’s side opens to the driver’s seat plus a cocooning rear seat behind, while twin coach doors and part of the panoramic roof open upwards on the passenger side to allow smoother entry and exit via a more luxurious and flexible passenger-side seat that can swivel 45 degrees outwards. “The seat can rotate and you step out, totally unflustered, not trying to clamber out of the car like you see with some supercars,” continued Day. “You just get out with dignity and the Instagram shot is perfect. If you look at the car we built for Her Majesty the Queen, it was always designed around the aperture of the door and ‘the art of arrival’. It was really important for us to create that feeling here too.”That passenger seat can also be moved to different positions according to customer mood or need: upfront alongside the driver in ‘Co-pilot’ mode, slid back to the rear-seat in ‘Standard’ setting or reclined for ‘Relax’ mode. In the latter two configurations massive legroom is created and the concept’s Concertina Floor Storage system allows footwell footrests to fold downward into the floor to create a shallow space for a pet or personal hand luggage to be strapped in – and crucially both accessible without needing to stop and open the boot.Even the boot holds more potential function than as mere luggage carrier. Open the large rear hatch and two small seats can deploy alongside an atmospheric physical lamp and fridge stocked with cold drinks, which can slide back from the rear seats, to truly make luxury tailgate parties a pleasurable and practical reality.The ‘Wing Gesture’ dashboard has long been a staple ingredient within Bentley cabins and is the brand’s first of five interior design principles, referencing the shape of the marque’s feathered emblem. The second principle – ‘Bold Gravitas’ – is about using luxury materials across large enough spaces for customers to really see and feel them properly. As Darren Day, said: “We are used to natural materials such as wood, metal – and now stone – in our cars and the human mind can tell whether something’s real or not because they’re used to seeing trees and animals and natural shapes. So we don’t try and over stylise these shapes but design them in unison with the form of the material. ‘Bold Gravitas’ is all about the confidence to have a generous amount of any one surface material, so you can really enjoy the wood veneer or the beauty of the metal.”The idea of a ‘Cocooning Haven’ is the brand’s third interior design principle and is about the importance of cossetting Bentley’s customers. Whether upfront or in the rear, the luxury passenger-side seat has an enveloping canopy on its left-hand side which wraps up and over the seat back to create privacy when desired. The fourth element – ‘Iconic Details’ – describes the now famous elements associated with Bentley interiors, from ‘bullseye’ air vents and knurled switchgear to diamond-quilted seats.The fifth interior design principle is a new one – dubbed ‘Magical Fusion’ – and is about Bentley’s intent to offer a mix of physical and digital features and in some instances merge the two. Like an update of Bentley’s existing ‘Rotating Dashboard’ which can reveal a infotainment screen at one moment and then rotate back to a solid dashboard surface when the screen is no longer required, EXP 15’s full-width dashboard can act as a digital interface for all manner of infotainment, or switch off to reveal a veneered wood surface visible underneath the glass. Also nestling centrally behind the screen is a clock-like device with multiple movable and illuminated fingers – called by its designers the ‘Mechanical Marvel’ – which can indicate the car’s direction of travel, the state of its electric charge and much more – or just be a delightful centrepiece to gaze upon. As Robin Page, said: “We think people are going to get fed up with a fully digital experience and are pining for physical mechanical elements too. By combining the two, you can get the best of both worlds. It’s almost like wearing a beautiful mechanical watch on one wrist and a digital watch on the other. Imagine the magical experience you would get if mechanical and digital are overlayed together.”The exterior of EXP 15 sports a striking liquid metal satin paintwork finish called Pallas Gold, which if you look closely features golden white highlights and is inspired by various nickel elements on the historic Bentley Speed Six, including its grille and door handles. But what makes this paint modern is a new-to-market, ultra-thin aluminium pigment which allows it to be used on bodywork in front of safety radar devices that can still transmit ‘through’ it without reducing signal quality. Furthermore, the coating’s high reflectivity makes it easy to be detected by Lidar systems and therefore suitable in traffic where other autonomous driving systems are deployed.On the virtual reality inside of EXP 15, the colour, trim and finish team has created four themes, with a mix of traditional and modern materials. Within the rear of the cabin designers have imagined the use of a fine silk jacquard textile to promote well-being. Woven in one of the UK’s oldest mills by the British company Gainsborough founded in 1903 – and a fabric supplier to the Queen since 1980 – the historic natural material sits in perfect harmony in the same interior as a new fine woven metal mesh called ‘Acrylic Couture’ which is encapsulated in acrylic and when illuminated can create radiant 3D effects within the dashboard.Similarly, back-lit materials sit behind cut veneers of Bentley’s signature quilting in the door cards and elsewhere, to add even more futuristic ambience. As Andrea Jensen, Head of Colour, Materials, Finish and Bespoke said: “When you cut a diamond pattern out of the veneer and put jacquard silk or a hybrid mesh against it and light it up, you can create what we’re calling an active 3D quilt.”Elsewhere a 100 per cent wool textile by Fox Brothers – the inventors of thorn-proof cloth and English weavers of some 250 years’ standing – is used in the damson ombre effect on EXP 15’s executive trim theme interior alongside real 3D-printed titanium finishes. And due to the material choice and its precise 3D-printed creation these metal details reduce both weight on the car and waste in production.Although a dramatic design concept first and foremost, EXP 15’s creators have of course considered the powertrain that will enable 21st century Grand Tours with sustainable ease and effortless performance. To that end, EXP 15 is conceived as having a fully-electric, all-wheel drive powertrain with a long range and recharging speeds commensurate with the convenience customers have come to expect of a Bentley. But as a design concept, no further details are being given of its technical specification nor possible platform.While the 1930 Speed Six Gurney Nutting Sportsman coupe certainly stimulated the current design team’s creativity, EXP 15 is far from an exercise in ‘retro’ or looking backwards and the cars clearly look nothing like each other. EXP 15 is not a preview of the smaller all-electric production Bentley vehicle expected in 2026 either. But subtle design cues relating to that first car are highlighted within this concept’s exterior form, as well as showcasing digital and technical ideas on the interior that could become reality in the longer-term."

            "article": "The new Ferrari Amalfi, a front-mid-engine V8 2+ coupé that replaces the Ferrari Roma in the Prancing Horse line-up, was unveiled today. The Ferrari Amalfi redefines the concept of contemporary sportiness, combining high performance, versatility, and refined aesthetics. Designed for those who want to enjoy sporty driving without sacrificing comfort and style, the Ferrari Amalfi stands out for its unprecedented balance between adrenaline and everyday usability.The car’s design stems from a fluid and minimalist approach, with sculpted volumes and clean surfaces that express modernity and dynamism. The front is dominated by a large air intake and a long, sculpted bonnet housing the 640 cv turbo V8 engine. At the rear, the integrated active spoiler contributes to high-speed stability, while forged wheels and carbon fibre details complete a sporty and sophisticated aesthetic.Inside, the cabin adopts a dual-cockpit layout, with a new steering wheel featuring physical buttons and the return of the iconic start button. The integrated central display and ergonomic controls ensure intuitive interaction with the car, even during dynamic driving. Extensive use of carbon fibre and contrasting stitching adds a touch of exclusivity, while the 2+ configuration allows the rear seats to be used to significantly increase the car’s practicality, enhancing cargo capacity and allowing trips with children.At the heart of the Ferrari Amalfi is an evolved twin-turbo V8 derived from the award-winning F154 family, capable of delivering 640 cv thanks to new turbocharging calibrations. The highly acclaimed eight-speed dual-clutch transmission ensures fast and smooth gear changes. Performance is outstanding: 0–100 km/h in 3.3 seconds, 0–200 km/h in 9.0 seconds, with a power-to-weight ratio of 2.29 kg/hp, the best in its class.Driving dynamics have been refined with the introduction of the brake-by-wire system, the ‘ABS Evo’ controller designed for all surfaces and conditions, and a recalibrated steering box for even more precise and progressive response. Active aerodynamics, with the new integrated rear mobile wing, ensure stability in all driving conditions and Manettino positions, helping to maximize dynamic performance.The Ferrari Amalfi incorporates the latest technological solutions from the Ferrari range: the infotainment system is fully connected, with Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto® as standard, paired with wireless smartphone charging. The new steering wheel, digital instrument cluster, and 10.25” horizontal central display offers an advanced human-machine interface designed to engage both driver and passenger. Among the features available on request is the addition of the front lifter system usable up to 35 km/h, allowing the car to easily overcome urban obstacles by raising it by up to 40 mm.Completing the onboard experience, the optional Burmester® premium audio system offers an immersive sound environment, designed to accompany every journey with quality and detail.The Ferrari Amalfi is aimed at those seeking a car that combines elegance and performance, emotion and functionality. A model that interprets the Ferrari sporting spirit in a modern key, offering a driving experience without compromise, in any context.The engine of the Ferrari Amalfi represents the latest evolution of the 3855-cc twin-turbo V8 from the F154 family, the one that has received the most international awards in recent automotive history. In this configuration, the power unit has been optimized to deliver a maximum output of 640 cv at 7,500 rpm, with a specific power of 166 cv/l and a redline raised to 7,600 rpm, allowing full exploitation of its continuously increasing power curve.The performance increase was achieved through an advanced turbocharging management system, enabling independent control of the rotational speed of the two turbochargers with dedicated calibration and an increase in the maximum turbo speed up to 171,000 rpm. This approach improves throttle response and boosts pressure control precision, also thanks to the introduction of dedicated pressure sensors for each cylinder bank. The new engine control unit, already used in models such as the 296 GTB, Ferrari Purosangue, and Ferrari 12Cilindri, has allowed the engine’s full potential to be harnessed.In parallel, efforts were made to reduce mass: new lightweight camshafts (-1.3 kg) and a redesigned engine block with precision machining eliminated non-structural material, saving about one kilogram. For the first time in a Ferrari engine, a low-viscosity oil has been introduced, reducing cold resistance by 30% compared to the previous version, improving warm-up efficiency.Throttle response is now even quicker thanks to a series of advanced technical solutions: a flat-plane crankshaft, compact low-inertia turbines, twin-scroll technology for separate exhaust gas management, and a single-scroll manifold with equal-length runners. These elements contribute to a sensation of continuous and progressive power delivery, with a torque curve shaped to provide stronger pull at mid and high revs in all gears.The eight-speed dual-clutch oil-bath transmission, first introduced with the SF90 Stradale to widespread acclaim, has been further optimized with a more powerful control unit and deeper integration with the engine software, improving shift smoothness and speed.Overall powertrain efficiency benefits from solutions such as the dry-sump gearbox configuration, low-friction bevel gear, and clutch torque management strategies that ensure extremely smooth urban driving, especially during Start&Stop phases.Sound design also received special attention: a new silencer layout was developed to meet the strictest noise emission regulations without compromising Ferrari’s signature tone. The flat-plane crankshaft and equal-length exhaust headers contribute to a distinctive firing sequence. The exhaust system features a ceramic matrix catalyst with a trimetallic coating (rhodium, platinum, palladium), with reduced activation times thanks to lower thermal inertia. Sound control is managed by a new proportionally controlled bypass valve with dedicated maps to adapt the exhaust note to different driving conditions."

            "article": "Three years after its presentation at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps in 2022, Ferrari has chosen the same race, the most important on the GT calendar, to unveil the new 296 GT3 Evo.The car builds on the experience gained with the 296 LMGT3 (which will compete in the FIA WEC from the 2024 season) and the 296 GT3, which, since its debut, has won five titles, including Drivers' and Team titles in the Pro class of the GT World Challenge Endurance Cup – the benchmark championship for GT3 cars – as well as victories at the Nürburgring 24 Hours and the 24 Hours at Daytona. The statistics take the tally to 140 victories, 405 podiums and 56 pole positions in 343 races.Client feedback and racing experience have led to the development of the 296 GT3 Evo, the result of targeted and concrete actions aimed at creating an even more competitive car in all conditions, while maintaining the concept of “modularity” that has made the 296 GT3 a true benchmark, especially in terms of ease of maintenance and set-up.The V6 combustion engine of the 296 GT3 Evo remains unchanged from the previous version. It retains the 120° V configuration with the turbochargers positioned inside the V, which offers significant benefits in terms of compactness and weight reduction, helping to achieve extremely high levels of power. Versatile, reliable and high-performing, the engine has always been appreciated for for its power delivery and torque since its debut.The engine remains in the same position as in the 296 GT3, positioned further forward and lower down than in the road-going version. This location helps to lower the centre of gravity and improve torsional rigidity. It was also tilted by 2° to allow more space for the rear diffuser.As for the gearbox, the 296 GT3 Evo adopts a new gear ratio cascade, optimised after analysing data collected during the car's two years of use, to favour torque delivery at both low and high speeds.The 296 GT3 Evo represents the next step in the evolution of the 296 GT3, a winning platform that already combines extreme aerodynamic performance and ease of load utilisation on the track. The goal set by Ferrari's engineers was to ensure a more predictable and stable response from the car in all race situations, while maintaining the performance of the standard 296 GT3 in terms of vertical load and efficiency, already pushed to the maximum allowed by the technical regulations. In engineering terms, the aerodynamics team focused on improving front vertical load stability when the 296 GT3 Evo is in the slipstream of another car, and aerodynamic sensitivity, i.e. minimising aerodynamic load variations.Almost all of the bodywork has been evolved. The profiles of the splitter and front floor have been revised, and the expansion volumes and vortex generators have been optimised. The appendages on the front bumper have also been modified in search of the best performance compromise.A further significant improvement has come from a thorough and careful review of the rear diffuser, which has been modified in terms of its expansion volumes and the number of channels.The third element to undergo development was the front wheel arch louvers, developed in synergy with the front underbody to ensure clean air enters the rear air intakes, both in free air and in the slipstream of other cars.For the development of the 296 GT3 Evo, the simulation methodology combining wind tunnel testing with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) calculations has been further improved, allowing the simulation of disturbed aerodynamic fields and the rapid testing of many geometric variations. The performance of the development package was then validated on the track, both in performance laps and in conditions involving other cars. The result of the research is summarised in the car's ability to maintain high aerodynamic performance in traffic and “disturbed” air, which are very common in endurance racing, stabilising the vertical load in the slipstream to the benefit of competitiveness and precision even in the most dynamic and unpredictable contexts.From an aesthetic and functional point of view, the 296 GT3 Evo is also recognisable by two air intakes in the front bonnet, which improve cooling for the brakes and the cockpit, as well as by the new rear wing, which has undergone significant changes. The support structure has been redesigned together with the side panels. The wing is now equipped with a quick adjustment mechanism, introduced for the first time in the LMGT3, which allows the wing angle to be adjusted using a simple screw, further improving track performance, already a distinctive feature of the 296 GT3.The development of the evolution package also involved internal aerodynamics, and in particular the cooling of the front brakes. Thanks to the optimisation of the ducts that convey air from the bumper to the discs and the introduction of two dynamic intakes on the bonnet, the overall airflow to the front brakes has increased by more than 20% compared to the 296 GT3. The steering pump also benefits from better and more effective cooling thanks to the introduction of two Naca intakes in the underbody.The entire rear wheel arch bodywork is borrowed from the LMGT3, which is distinguished by a more vertical curvature at the front, making it easier to accommodate the various types of tyres from different suppliers used in GT championships around the world. The rear-view mirrors also benefit from this experience and have been further improved thanks to a series of studies and calculations aimed at investigating the frequencies and modes of vibration of the exterior mirrors in the current version. These new parts have been moved inwards, changing their angle and improving visibility at the same time.Both the front and rear suspension kinematics have been modified with the aim of reducing loads on the components and improving reliability. At the same time, the new design ensures a connected dynamic response between the front and rear, as well as facilitating setup operations in the pits.Intuitive, visibility and accessibility are the key principles around which the development of the 296 GT3's cockpit has been defined, without forgetting fundamental aspects such as safety and comfort. The 296 GT3 Evo retains these basic characteristics, but significantly improves the air conditioning system, which has been enhanced with an additional fan to make it even more effective.The 296 GT3 Evo, whose homologation process will be completed once the final aerodynamic refinements are underway, will make its debut in the 2026 season and will also be available as an upgrade kit for those competing with the 296 GT3."

            "article": "The Peralta S, the first one-off made by GFG Style, was unveiled at the Pastejé Automotive Invitational, Mexico's prestigious and exclusive automotive event, on Saturday, March 22, 2025. Inspired by a famous concept car by Giorgetto Giugiaro from the 1970s, the Peralta S was designed by Fabrizio Giugiaro and developed by GFG Style's advanced styling center, commissioned by Mexican car collector Carlos Peralta and his sons Juan Carlos and Nicolas.The Peralta S, a mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car, is a futuristic car made entirely by hand from fully exposed, mirror-polished aluminum, with the special feature that there is no visual difference between the glazed surfaces and the body, creating a monolithic effect.It is distinguished by numerous original styling elements, the result of Giugiaro's experience and continuous drive for innovation: above all, the spectacular opening of the “dome” in a single movement.The Peralta S is a dream car with strong references to the past, in particular to the Maserati Boomerang prototype designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro in 1971. A car of absolute rupture for the time, with an angular but harmonious style, taut lines and a wedge-shaped silhouette that made history, it has become a true icon over the years: in fact, there are many cars that have been inspired by it.In the words of Fabrizio Giugiaro: “The Peralta S has a typically 1970s attitude and has nothing to do with today's cars. I wanted to embellish it with quotations, styling cues and references to shapes from a past that made history, but it is also a tribute to my father, through the reinterpretation in a modern key of the volumes of the Boomerang.”“There are dozens of sports cars” - continues Fabrizio - “that have become iconic that took their cues from those shapes, it was pure avant-garde. For me it is one of Giorgetto's most incredible and successful stylistic exercises.”The side view is characterized by a silhouette with one seamless line: nose, roof, tail with only two edges. Even from above, the surfaces are flat and continuous. A single shape that presents itself as if it were a large monolith. All emphasized by the choice to leave the polished aluminum exposed. In plan the Peralta S is teardrop-shaped with closure in the rear, while the front end is simple: all the lights are enclosed and hidden in both the nose and rear.The only nonaluminum parts are the front spoiler, rear diffuser and side sills, all of which are made of exposed carbon fiber. The rear is characterized by the integrated spoiler that lifts up and the taillights that are hidden underneath: when lit they create an interesting “shadow light” effect.Note the absence of traditional doors: the opening, which provides access to the passenger compartment, is through the lifting of a single “dome”. There is, however, provision for independent opening of the side windows by means of a gull-wing movement.This dream car has a double soul: when closed - and therefore switched off - it looks like a single monolith, while when switched on it changes its physiognomy, thanks to the spoiler that rises and the upper and lower labs that open to promote greater ventilation.In terms of construction, the body of the Peralta S is made in three distinct pieces: hood, central mirrored glass part and rear. Chassis and mechanics, on the other hand, are derived from the Maserati MC 20, whose technical characteristics have remained unchanged and unaltered, with the technical collaboration of MAT - Manifattura Automobili Torino."

            "article": "Chevrolet is introducing an all-wheel drive Corvette worthy of the storied ZR1 designation: the 2026 Corvette ZR1X. With 1,250 horsepower1 and electrified all-wheel drive, ZR1X is a true American hypercar and the most advanced Corvette ever. With ZR1 and ZR1X, Chevrolet now has the most powerful American performance car duo of any auto manufacturer.ZR1X features:LT7 twin-turbo V8: 1,064 horsepower at 7,000 rpm, 828 lb-ft of torque at 6,000 rpmFront-axle motor: 186 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torqueGM-estimated 0-60: Under 2 secondsGM-estimated ¼ mile: Under 9 seconds, with trap speed over 150 mph“From day one, we designed the mid-engine Corvette architecture with ZR1X in mind,” said General Motors senior VP Ken Morris. “This is the most revolutionary platform in Corvette history, supporting the widest range of American sports cars3 and delivering world-class performance at every level.”America’s hypercar starts with the ZR1’s LT7 V8, generating more power than any other V8 produced by an American auto manufacturer — 1,064 horsepower and 828 lb-ft of torque, sent to the rear wheels through an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. With a forged flat-plane crankshaft, finger-follower valvetrain, and dry-sump lubrication, this hand-built 5.5-liter Gemini small-block V8 was developed alongside the naturally aspirated flat-plane crankshaft engines powering the Corvette Z06 and Z06 GT3.R race car. This mighty V8 includes:Dual 76-mm turbochargersA “maniturbo” exhaust design that combines the manifold and turbocharger housing to get the turbos as close to the exhaust valves as possible, improving throttle response by decreasing time needed to build boostDynamic anti-lag controls that maintain turbo speed when off-throttle in certain situations so boost is available rapidly when throttle is reappliedWhere ZR1 embodies the rear-wheel drive precedent set by prior generations, the Corvette team added all-wheel drive capability for a new take on performance. ZR1X benefits from the foundation set in 2024 by E-Ray, the first-ever AWD Corvette, combining a high-voltage battery pack and electric motor driving the front axle with V8 propulsion turning the rear axle. There is no physical connection between the two power sources on ZR1X, and the electrified propulsion system does not require a plug-in — charging takes place through regenerative efforts from the front drive unit.ZR1X’s battery pack, located low and centralized within the rigid spine of the chassis, was designed specifically to rapidly cycle between applying bursts of power and charging. This robust pack has been tested at tracks around the world and conquered Corvette’s 24-hour track durability test. While the battery capacity is 1.9 kWh like E-Ray, the usable energy has grown to provide greater lapping capability. This improvement raises the peak operating voltage, which increases the power output from the front drive unit.The compact electric motor on the front axle is capable of 186 hp and 145 lb-ft of torque on demand. While retaining the same shape and size of the E-Ray front drive unit, the ZR1X unit pairs strengthened internal components and improvements in energy deployment to generate an additional 26 hp and 20 lb-ft of torque. The front axle is engaged and can apply power through 160 mph before disconnecting, directly benefitting ZR1X’s quarter-mile acceleration stats and on-track balance.The eAWD chassis controls system designed for E-Ray has undergone a significant upgrade for ZR1X. With the benefit of experience on this electrified AWD architecture, the development team applied knowledge from E-Ray to solutions specifically for the LT7’s character and capability. The result is evident in on-road drivability and on-track performance. ZR1X is constantly monitoring driver inputs and vehicle conditions to blend power at both axles for responsiveness and traction management.On track, ZR1X utilizes specialized energy strategies designed to maximize electrified output based on track session demands and driver preferences:Endurance – Engaging the Charge+ button adjusts the battery’s energy storage strategy for extended lapping and consistent eAWD output for a full tank of fuelQualifying – Optimum power strategy for the ultimate lap timePush-to-Pass – Max available power on-demandPTM Pro, new for 2026 on all Corvettes, was designed with ZR1X in mind. PTM Pro delivers the purest driving experience. While this setting turns off traction and stability control, the following features remain active:Regen Brake Torque Vectoring – engineered to recover peak energy without sacrificing agilityFront Axle Pre-Control – actively manages inside front brake pressure to enable maximum corner-exit tractionLaunch Control – customizable settings enable rapid acceleration from a restThe ZR1X balances impressive power with robust brakes specifically developed with this car in mind. The J59 braking package, standard on ZR1X and an option on ZR1, is a clean-sheet design intended for superior heat resistance and ultra-responsive braking.Alcon 10-piston front and 6-piston rear calipers are mated to 16.5-inch front and rear rotors — the largest diameter rotors ever offered on Corvette. The rotors are carbon ceramic, constructed with continuously woven carbon fiber threads.This is the most resilient production car braking system we’ve tested within GM. And during testing, we saw J59-equipped Corvettes achieve 1.9G of deceleration from 180 to 120 mph.ZR1X is offered in two chassis configurations that both feature magnetic ride control — adjusting to the vehicle’s mode, driver inputs and the road surface for optimal control. The standard chassis, accompanied by Michelin PS4S tires, makes for a comfortable touring car on-road and a highly capable Corvette at the track. The available ZTK Performance Package incorporates higher spring rates and is firmer. Paired with the grip of Michelin’s Pilot Cup 2R tires, this is the pinnacle of Corvette performance.Customers can equip the high-downforce Carbon Aero package to a standard chassis ZR1X, adding dive planes, underbody strakes, a hood gurney lip over the front heat extractor and a highly effective rear wing. This package is capable of 1,200 lbs of downforce at top speed and comes standard on ZTK-equipped cars.The 2026 Corvette ZR1X is the ultimate expression of the no-compromise eighth generation platform. It’s an all-day comfortable tourer, a straight-line rocket, and a racetrack weapon, all in one. Like every iconic sports car in the Corvette lineup, ZR1X will be available in coupe or hardtop convertible body style. ZR1X enters the market with Corvette’s fresh interior revealed last month. A new three-screen layout and reimagined console design, real-time vehicle data provided by the built-in Performance App, and new colors and high-quality materials all highlight the 2026 Corvette interior.Every ZR1X will be proudly built in America at General Motors’ Bowling Green Assembly Plant in Kentucky from U.S. and globally sourced parts, with every LT7 engine hand-assembled by the master engine builders at the Bowling Green Performance Build Center. Further details on price and availability will be shared closer to production."

            "article": "With increased power, reduced weight, a track-focused interior, upgraded brakes and suspension, and finely tuned aerodynamics, Sadair’s Spear delivers an extraordinary combination of blistering track capability and full road legality across global markets and sets a new bar in Koenigsegg´s performance evolution.The inspiration behind the name \"Sadair’s Spear\" is deeply personal. Christian von Koenigsegg previously honoured his father, Jesko, on his 80th birthday by naming the Koenigsegg Jesko after him—a heartfelt tribute for his invaluable support during Koenigsegg’s formative years.Jesko von Koenigsegg was a passionate gentleman jockey with lifelong ties to Sweden’s equestrian community. His favourite racehorse—the one he rode in his final race in 1976—was named Sadair’s Spear.Fittingly, the car bearing this storied name is uncompromisingly engineered for peak track performance.Performance Highlights:A new lightweight, top-mounted double-blade active rear wing optimized for increased downforce.Elongated rear-end design to enhance aerodynamic efficiency and stability.Expanded front canards, louvres, and reengineered hood vents, including a new Gurney flap, delivering superior cooling for sustained high-performance.Redesigned air intakes for enhanced engine breathing, adding 20hp with standard fuel and 25hp using E85.Improved oil cooling capability, essential for sustained track driving in high-temperature conditions.Exclusive Sadair’s Spear 7-spoke turbine-blade Aircore carbon fibre wheels, with unique directional designs at each corner.Upgraded wider, track-oriented tires for exceptional grip.Bespoke suspension setup featuring lightweight springs and Koenigsegg-designed Triplex dampers for superior track handling.Enhanced multi-layer carbon-ceramic brakes with upgraded pad materials.Bespoke interior styling exclusive to Sadair’s Spear.Unique Sadair’s Spear racing seats with optional 6-point harnesses.Unmatched aerodynamic performance is central to Sadair’s Spear. Koenigsegg’s advanced CFD team meticulously optimized airflow, ensuring unprecedented downforce and cooling. The active, top-mounted double-blade rear wing is carefully crafted for maximum cornering traction at track speeds, working in harmony with refined underfloor strakes and wheel arch louvres.Balancing this rear downforce, the front-end aero package—including larger canards, enhanced hood vents, and refined wheel arch louvres—further increases cooling efficiency and downforce. Together with the front Triplex damper and Active Ride Height system, these enhancements deliver extraordinary steering feedback and dynamic handling.Specially designed rear hood scoops further boost engine performance at high speeds, while a revised front hood vent with integrated Gurney flap ensures optimal cooling airflow, providing additional downforce in critical areas.Powering Sadair’s Spear is Koenigsegg’s formidable twin-turbo V8 engine, delivering astonishing responsiveness via the revolutionary flywheel-free Light Speed Transmission (LST), capable of revving at a staggering 46,000 rpm/s.Enhanced airflow and cooling, coupled with an engine calibration update, increase output to 1,300hp on regular unleaded fuel, and up to 1,625hp using eco-friendly E85 fuel.Celebrating a decade since the groundbreaking Koenigsegg One:1, Sadair’s Spear pushes the power-to-weight boundary even further, dropping around 35 kg of weight to achieve an extraordinary ratio, even surpassing the iconic 1:1 benchmark.Koenigsegg continues its unmatched legacy as the world’s only premier manufacturer of fully homologated road vehicles exceeding a 1:1 power-to-weight ratio.Inside, the cockpit of Sadair’s Spear showcases a lightweight, minimalist center console and redesigned carbon fibre seats. Standard three-point seatbelts can be optionally upgraded to a 6-point racing harness.True to its track-oriented philosophy, gear changes via the Light Speed Transmission are executed solely through steering wheel-mounted paddles.Weight reduction continues throughout the interior, saving 2.6 kg through reduced sound insulation, another 1.3 kg with new carbon fibre techniques, and further contributions from lightweight interior and mechanical components, collectively shedding 35 kg.Koenigsegg’s hallmark comforts and advanced features remain: the steering-mounted SmartCluster display, SmartCenter command interface, USB connectivity, inductive phone charging, Koenigsegg’s innovative Autoskin system, and birds-eye parking assist.The final creation is both visually captivating and mechanically groundbreaking, expertly balanced to dominate on roads and circuits alike.During initial shake-down tests at Gotland Ring, Sadair’s Spear immediately shattered the previous lap record, set by the Jesko Attack by an impressive 1.1 seconds, demonstrating its immense untapped potential.Christian von Koenigsegg states: “Sadair’s Spear represents a natural progression for Koenigsegg—an impeccable balance of raw power, refined aerodynamics, and extraordinary road presence. This car is destined to set records. Achieving such track dominance in a fully road-legal vehicle is nothing short of remarkable.”Sadair’s Spear, with production strictly limited to 30 units—all instantly sold upon its private unveiling—is an iconic addition to Koenigsegg’s storied legacy."

            "article": "In the birthplace of Italy’s greatest automotive legends, a new name joins the story. Today, Giamaro Automobili officially launches, introducing a new force in the world of ultra-high performance motoring — a brand defined by vision, soul, and technical audacity.Rooted in the traditions of Modena’s Motor Valley yet uncompromisingly forward-looking, Giamaro Automobili emerges with a bold statement of intent: a ground-up engineered V12 quad-turbo engine, a fully functioning first hypercar, and a category-creating second model that redefines the performance landscape.“We founded Giamaro Automobili to create something rare, authentic, and unrepeatable — something with soul, courage, and clarity of purpose,” said founders Giacomo and Pierfrancesco Commendatore. “For us, a car must be more than fast or beautiful. It must stir something deeper — it must transcend. It must connect with the person who lives it, becoming an extension of their identity. Our goal was never to chase trends or numbers, but to create machines that evoke feeling, provoke thought, and leave a lasting mark. Giamaro is for those who believe a car should move the heart before it moves the wheels.”Giamaro’s official launch event took place at 7:00 PM on May 22, 2025, at the brand’s research and development headquarters in Cavezzo, the Giamaro Automobili Engineering. The event welcomed representatives of local and national institutions, clients, partners, and members of the international press.Invited guests—including representatives of local and national institutions, clients, partners, and members of the international press—witnessed a symbolic moment that marks the official beginning of an ambitious journey, driven by passion, technical excellence, and a strong identity — from a vision shaped in Modena, to a new marque ready to take on the world.What began as a simple question — what if — soon became something more powerful, sparking a vision: why not?For years, ideas and intuitions stirred quietly beneath the surface, like the dormant energy of a volcano. In 2021, that latent force was awaken — not to follow convention, but to defy it.This is how Giamaro Automobili was born: a new Italian brand founded in Modena with the ambition to create something timeless and deeply personal. Not just a hypercar, but a living, breathing creation—capable of evoking emotion, meaning, and connection.Giamaro represents a unique fusion of soul and engineering - visceral, versatile, and tailored to those who live it. Each vehicle is designed to deliver a pure, instinctive driving experience—where every moment behind the wheel ignites connection. The goal goes beyond the boundaries of engineering and into something elemental and primal: the very essence of emotion.A Giamaro is not simply driven; it is felt. It is a balance between performance and poetry, instinct and vision, to deliver a connection between driver and machine that defies logic.Giamaro is for those who feel first and think later. A marque for those who appreciate rarity, and who understand that craftsmanship is a pursuit, not a finish line. Behind every creation lies a devotion to the art of driving, to the romance of performance, and to the belief that true luxury lies beyond restraint – and true mastery begins where limits end.True luxury lies not in excess, but in exclusivity — and in experiences tailored to the individual.At Giamaro Automobili, personalisation is not a menu of options; it is a deeply collaborative journey. Human, intuitive, and full of inspiration. From the first sketch to final calibration, each client becomes part of the creative process, working alongside our designers and engineers to shape a machine that is uniquely theirs.This co-creation goes far beyond aesthetics — it’s a conversation between longing and engineering. Steering feel, suspension behaviour, personalised driving modes, throttle mapping — every dynamic element is tuned to match a unique and personal vision of the perfect drive.The result is not just ownership, but authorship.“No two Giamaros are ever the same, because no two clients are ever the same,” Commendatore said. “We don’t build cars for customers — we build them with them. That’s the only way to create the kind of authentic bond that transforms each vehicle into a personal expression — an extension of who you are, and how you move through the world”.At the core of every Giamaro creation lies the brand’s defining innovation: a completely new, 6,988 cc quadturbo V12 engine, designed in a 120° “hot V” configuration.Developed entirely in-house from a blank sheet, this powertrain is far more than an engineering milestone—it is a manifesto of power and sophistication, the purest expression of Giamaro’s identity. Delivering 1,670 PS at 8,500 rpm and 1,556 Nm of maximum torque, it unleashes a surging crescendo of mechanical emotion. In its most extreme configuration, it climbs to 2,157 PS at 9,000 rpm and 2,008 Nm of peak torque, releasing a raw, visceral, and primal force.This is no borrowed architecture or reimagined classic. It is a purpose-built masterpiece — engineered for perfect balance and crafted to achieve pure dynamic performance. A symbol of vision, excellence, and relentless ambition, it is the beating heart of every Giamaro.“This engine represents everything we stand for — a passionate love letter to pure engineering ,” added Commendatore. “There’s a spirit in the V12 that no other configuration can replicate. It speaks a visceral language, straight to the heart. It doesn’t just move — it takes hold of you, ignites your senses, and leaves a lasting impression”."

            "article": "On June 11, 2025, Ligier Automotive unveiled the Ligier JS P3X at the 24 Hours of Le Mans circuit. A special anniversary series, limited to ten units, to celebrate the ten-year milestone of Ligier’s first LMP3, the JS P3. A tribute to a decade of passion and performance that began alongside Guy Ligier in 2015.On June 11, 2015, at the 24 Hours of Le Mans circuit, Jacques Nicolet—then President of Onroak Automotive and the OAK Racing team—introduced the company’s first LMP3, the Ligier JS P3. This moment marked a new chapter in Ligier’s return to endurance racing, less than a year after the competition debut of the Ligier JS P2, Ligier’s first LMP2 prototype.“This launch remains one of the most unforgettable moments in our history. We had taken a major step forward with the LMP2, and the LMP3 was the logical next phase in our commitment to building an ambitious, accessible endurance racing ladder. Standing beside Guy Ligier that day, watching him pass on the passion and determination that define the brand’s DNA one final time, was deeply moving,” recalls Jacques Nicolet, President of Ligier Automotive.Since then, each generation of Ligier LMP3 has been revealed at the legendary Circuit de la Sarthe: the Ligier JS P3 in 2015, the JS P320 in 2019, the JS P325 in 2024, and now, the JS P3X.Since 2015, Ligier Automotive has established itself as the benchmark in LMP3 racing. The Ligier JS P3 launched the momentum: 100 cars sold in just two years and 18 titles won between 2015 and 2019 across all major LMP3 series.The success only grew with the Ligier JS P320:31 LMP3 titles won since 2020,Victories at top endurance events, including the 24 Hours of Daytona, the 12 Hours of Sebring, and Petit Le Mans,Continued dominance in the European Le Mans Series (ELMS), Michelin Le Mans Cup (MLMC), Asian Le Mans Series, IMSA, Ultimate Cup Series, Endurance Brasil, and more.In 2025, the Ligier JS P325 takes over with a spectacular competition debut: pole positions, race wins, and all-Ligier podiums in the opening rounds of ELMS and MLMC at Barcelona and Le Castellet, plus 31 entries for Road to Le Mans.To mark this decade of success, Ligier Automotive introduces the Ligier JS P3X—an exclusive model based on the Ligier JS P320, limited to just ten units.“The Ligier JS P3X embodies everything we’ve learned over ten years of LMP3 racing: a pure blend of performance, design, and passion. It honors our legacy and looks to our future,” says Jacques Nicolet.Why “X”? For 10 units. For exceptional. The JS P3X is both a technical and visual tribute to the Ligier LMP3 line.Under the hood, the Ligier JS P3X features a 625-horsepower GM LT1 V8 engine.With more than 155 extra horsepower compared to current LMP3s, the Ligier JS P3X underwent extensive aerodynamic development. The front end has been redesigned with a new splitter, optimized wheel arches, and a hood inspired by LMP2 styling. At the rear, a new engine cover—evoking the spirit of Hypercars—restores overall balance.The new front hood also improves the cooling system to match the increased power.The signature dynamic qualities of Ligier’s LMP3s are retained. But with its boosted performance and the addition of an ABS system, the Ligier JS P3X is an even more capable and thrilling prototype, while remaining accessible and enjoyable to drive.“With the JS P3X, we set out to create an even more radical car that brings together the best of all three LMP3 generations. It delivers greater performance while keeping an intuitive driving feel. It’s a true driver’s gem,” adds Jacques Nicolet.The Ligier JS P3X is more than just performance. It comes with:Exclusive liveries for each chassis, in ten unique colorsA spare front end and two sets of wheelsA personalized B.R.M Chronographes watch in the car’s colors, with the model name on the dial and the chassis number engraved on the back"

            "article": "TOYOTA GAZOO Racing has unveiled the GR LH2 Racing Concept, a liquid hydrogen (LH2) fueled test car to advance the development of hydrogen technology in motorsports. It made its public debut at the Circuit de la Sarthe where it is being exhibited at the H2 Village, organized by the Automobile Club de l’Ouest, during the 93rd Le Mans 24 Hours (11-15 June).As part of its efforts to make ever-better cars through motorsports as the starting point, and to realize a carbon-neutral society, Toyota has advanced its technologies in the challenging environment of motorsports, including the Super Taikyu series in Japan. It has also accelerated its efforts to expand the production, transportation, and use of hydrogen together with partners inside and outside the industry, towards the realization of a carbon-neutral society.Toyota has taken on the challenge of hydrogen engine development in motorsports, initially through Rookie Racing’s participation in the Japanese Super Taikyu series with the hydrogen-engine Corolla, which initially used gaseous hydrogen from 2021, before the introduction of a liquid hydrogen-powered car from 2023. The potential of hydrogen engines in rallying was showcased in 2022 when the GR Yaris H2 completed demonstration runs on Ypres Rally, a round of the FIA World Rally Championship.In 2023, the hydrogen-engine Corolla completed a demonstration lap of the Circuit de la Sarthe, while a hydrogen engine concept car, the GR H2 Racing Concept, was presented to preview a potential future hydrogen category at Le Mans. Since then, development of the technology intensified, reaching a new milestone with the unveiling of the liquid hydrogen-powered GR LH2 Racing Concept. It is based on the GR010 HYBRID Hypercar which currently participates in the FIA World Endurance Championship. Through future track testing, the GR LH2 Racing Concept will support Toyota’s continuous development of hydrogen technology and infrastructure, as well as helping build relationships to expand the possibilities of hydrogen through the challenge of motorsports.The presentation of the forward-looking GR LH2 Racing Concept completes a celebration of past, present and future which marks the 40th anniversary of Toyota’s first participation at Le Mans, following the introduction of a unique combination of livery designs. The #7 GR010 HYBRID of Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi and Nyck de Vries carries a red and white tribute livery inspired by the iconic TS020 which participated in 1998. The #8 GR010 HYBRID – driven by Sébastien Buemi, Brendon Hartley and Ryo Hirakawa – represents the team’s present determination to win. Its matt black livery is built around a GR logo, capturing the team’s “Hate to lose” spirit and the “Prototype” concept of making ever-better motorsports-bred cars and continuous evolution."

            "article": "Aston Martin is proud to celebrate its famous return to the pinnacle of endurance motorsport by revealing today the spectacular Valkyrie LM, a new, ultra-exclusive and non-homologated variant of the only road-derived racing hypercar to bid for overall victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.This exceptional version of the world’s ultimate hypercar represents a historic landmark in the luxury high performance brand’s sporting history, whose legacy intertwines back to the very roots of the most famous motor race of them all. Aston Martin first entered Le Mans in 1928, five years after the event’s inception. Now after multiple class wins through the decades, and five since 2014, the Wings return to the top echelon of the sport with Valkyrie, as Aston Martin bids for outright victory for the first time since 1959, when Roy Salvadori (GBR) and Carroll Shelby (USA) triumphed with the Aston Martin DBR1.The Valkyrie LM is born from the Valkyrie Hypercar race car – the first of any kind built to the FIA’s ‘Hypercar’ regulations that is contesting both the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship [WEC] and the North American-based IMSA WeatherTech Sports Car Championship [IMSA]. Like the Valkyrie that lines up on the grid for this week’s 24 Hours of Le Mans, the LM is powered by a modified, lean-burn version of the sensational Cosworth-built 6.5-litre naturally aspirated V12 engine, tuned to an identical regulation-limited 520kW (697bhp).Aston Martin CEO, Adrian Hallmark said: “In all its forms, there is nothing on Earth that compares to Valkyrie. The Le Mans contender is unique amongst its peers, not least the breathtaking 6.5-litre V12 engine that provides the beating heart for the only competitive hypercar bred from a road car.“Valkyrie LM is an exquisite opportunity to be part of the most exclusive Aston Martin owners club in the world; a group who can immerse themselves in the purest and most comparable endurance driving experience, one that would otherwise only be available to our works drivers operating at the very limit of sportscar racing’s highest echelon. Through the decades, Aston Martin has striven to give its owners the truest sense of the performance bred from its racing cars. With Valkyrie LM, there has never been an opportunity to get closer to the raw dynamic forces and state of the art technology deployed by the hypercar currently competing in WEC and IMSA.”The Valkyrie LM truly represents a driving experience directly comparable to the elite performance levels of sportscar racing’s pinnacle Hypercar class. Its differentiation is minimal to the cars competing in WEC and IMSA and focusses on ensuring the Valkyrie LM is fully accessible to amateur drivers. Race series specific items such as ballast and FIA-regulation electronics will be removed, with a bespoke cockpit interface tailored for track day usage. User-friendly open-loop torque control (rather than closed-loop which exists for competition regulation and homologation), torque sensors that manage power delivery on the race car are removed, optimising the driving experience for customers. The V12 engine will be recalibrated to accept readily available fuel.The rear-wheel-drive Valkyrie LM is driven through a seven-speed sequential transmission operated by semi-automatic paddle shift gear change, just like the competitive version. The racing suspension configuration features double wishbones front and rear, with pushrod actuated torsion bar springs with adjustable side and central dampers. The Valkyrie LM will run on bespoke performance tyres from F1® tyre supplier Pirelli.The cockpit is optimised for driver safety, access and visibility, with a custom carbon-fibre race seat with shoulder support and headrest padding surround. It features a six-point FIA 8853 safety harness and fire suppression system, while the steering wheel has an integrated driver display and shift lights.Adam Carter, Aston Martin’s Head of Endurance Motorsport said: “It is important to emphasise that the Valkyrie LM is close to identical to the race car that is currently competing in WEC and IMSA, with only a few minor deviations to ensure it is a non-homologated variant and is accessible for customers to experience and enjoy. Valkyrie LM represents the most authentic Hypercar track experience that is now available.”Valkyrie LM owners will be free to take full possession of their car, but Aston Martin is also creating a dedicated driver development programme that is tailored to support, harness and optimise their driving ability and provide them with the ultimate topflight motorsport experience. Removing the stress of running track sessions independently and ensuring the car is set-up and prepared with the same expertise as it was intended to be for the race track, the programme is sculpted to assist drivers as they build their confidence and explore the limits of a machine designed to operate in excess of 200mph on the fast, flat-out kinks of the most famous racetrack in the world. Operated on a ‘fly-in-and-drive’ basis, the programme will be fully managed by a professional team of engineers and will immerse the owners in the programme as they explore the capabilities of the car in a safe and controlled environment.The cars tethered to this programme will be stored and maintained by Aston Martin and transported to and from the Valkyrie LM Performance Club venues, with simulator driver coaching sessions included before clients drive Valkyrie LM on track. Guided by Aston Martin’s dedicated professional driver coaches, clients will gain extra preparation through detailed track walks and classroom sessions before they are unleashed under one-on-one supervision. The Valkyrie LM’s engineering team will also offer data and onboard video analysis to fully optimise the driving experience.The dedicated programme offers an extensive vehicle and driver kit, including helmet, Head and Neck Safety (HANS) device, driver’s suit and boots, moulded earpieces, drivers gloves and fireproof underwear.The driver development programme promises to be the most exceptional Aston Martin ownership experience in the ultra-luxury brand’s long history. The new customer will participate in an exclusive handover event and their first opportunity to experience the Valkyrie LM in Q2 2026 with two further fully supported track days incorporated into the British brand’s UNLEASHED experience scheduled for Q3 2026 and Q4 2026 at F1® standard race circuits. The first year of the programme will culminate in a special evening held at Aston Martin’s headquarters at Gaydon in December which will include a Valkyrie LM customer dinner. All aspects of the programme will be subject to exclusive accommodation and chauffeur service for Aston Martin’s Valkyrie LM owners.From its conception in 2016, Valkyrie has been the apex of its class. From the original road going Valkyrie Coupe and subsequent Valkyrie Spider, each iteration has had its own story and experience for the driver. Valkyrie LM now brings present-day top-class motorsport to the hands of an exclusive number of customers who will experience the journey of an Aston Martin endurance racing driver. The car is designed to challenge and excite drivers of any background but will be tuned to the development of each client as they progress through their journey.Valkyrie LM is strictly limited to 10 examples, with deliveries due in time for the bespoke, fully managed and immersive track day programme that will be launched in Q2 2026."

            "article": "As Porsche prepares for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a sister to the 963 Hypercar has been revealed – named the 963 RSP. An extreme one-off based on the IMSA championship and WEC championship winning machine, the car closely follows the design direction taken by a very special 917 50 years ago. Fittingly, it made its debut today on the streets near the Circuit de la Sarthe alongside the car that inspired its creation.The work of a team from Porsche AG, Porsche Penske Motorsport and Porsche Cars North America in partnership with motorsport legend Roger Penske, whose initials form the name of the car, the 963 RSP was influenced by the trailblazing 917 and an audacious drive that took place half a century ago.In April 1975, a 917 (chassis 30) – the most advanced endurance race car at that time – made an extraordinary journey, not on the track, but on public roads. From the factory in Zuffenhausen, it traveled to Paris - at the wheel was its enigmatic owner, who insisted on as few changes as possible to the car, which remains in France, and on the road, to this day.“This really started out as a “what if?” – a passion project by a small team of enthusiasts at Penske and at Porsche who together imagined a version of the 963 that really resembled as closely as possible the spirit and appearance of the Count Rossi 917,” said Porsche Cars North America President and CEO Timo Resch, who conceived of the original idea. “The 917 from the story was every inch a race car – albeit one driven on the road – and we took the same approach with the 963 RSP. It uses beautiful materials of the best quality available, but is still every bit a race car underneath.”The 963 RSP features significant changes over the car on which it is based. Unlike the competition racecars, which are wrapped in different colors, the 963 RSP is the first of its kind to be painted; a unique challenge due to the nature of the carbon fiber and Kevlar® bodywork which is ultra-thin in places to save weight. In a nod to the Count Rossi 917, the 963 RSP is finished in Martini Silver and features uniquely altered bodywork and a bespoke tan leather and Alcantara interior inspired by the trim choices made by Count Rossi 50 years ago. A dedicated mechanical and electronic setup were configured for its debut on the streets near Le Mans – including a raised ride height and softened dampers, as well as a reprogrammed control unit to allow for the headlights and taillights to operate closer to those of a road car. These changes along with modified bodywork to cover the wheel arches, the use of Michelin wet weather compound tires and even the fitment of a horn meant the car met the necessary criteria to be allowed to drive on the road and wear license plates under special permission from the French authorities and with the enthusiastic support of the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), which runs the 24 Hours of Le Mans race.“That was an experience that will stay with me for a lifetime,” said Timo Bernhard, who was at the wheel of the 963 RSP for its first miles on the road. “Driving down a public road with a 917 beside me – it felt unreal. The car behaved perfectly – it felt a little friendlier and more forgiving than the normal 963 – and felt super special and a lot more comfortable, especially as I was not needing all my safety gear.”“We have enjoyed a terrific relationship with Porsche dating back to 1972. The Porsche 917/30, in particular, was one of the greatest eras in Team Penske history with numerous wins and championships, along with the closed-course speed record set by Mark Donohue in 1975,” said Roger Penske, Chairman of the Penske Corporation. “With such a remarkable partnership continuing to this day, we felt it was time to create the most exciting car we could imagine. Just like the 917, I wanted this car to be authentic to its origin and have as few changes to it as possible. When we got into the project, the differences in the two generations of race cars provided a great challenge. What emerged is a car that has lost none of its edge and is exciting whether on the track or on the road.”The 963 RSP will go on public display at the Circuit de la Sarthe during the 24 Hours of Le Mans before it returns to Stuttgart to be shown at the Porsche Museum. In July the car will appear alongside the 917 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed."

            "article": "The new Bentayga Speed is the most powerful, most dynamic and most exhilarating Bentley SUV yet. It eclipses even its acclaimed W12-engined predecessor, delivering increased power and performance along with the most dynamic chassis set-up ever offered on a Bentayga – including, for the first time, the ability to generate on-throttle slip angles in Bentley’s pinnacle performance SUV. At its heart is a new twin-turbo 4.0-litre V8 engine that produces 650 PS and 850 Nm of torque. This new powertrain is capable of accelerating Bentley’s SUV performance flagship from 0-62 mph in just 3.4 seconds and delivers a top speed of 193mph (310km/h). The new Bentayga Speed also features significant advances in dynamic capability – with an enhanced SPORT chassis mode and a new ESC Dynamic setting that brings maximum driver involvement and the choice between enhanced road-holding or the ability to slide the car on-power. The new chassis set up and powerful engine confirm the Bentayga Speed’s position as a new performance pinnacle for the luxury SUV. The Bentayga Speed’s new 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine delivers exceptional performance, with peak power of 650 PS / 641 bhp / 478 kW and a 0-60 mph time of just 3.4 seconds. These figures comprehensively surpass those of the Bentayga V8 S (4.4 seconds) as well as the 3.9 second mark set by the previous W12-engined Bentayga Speed. Peak torque of 850 Nm (627 lb.ft) is delivered between 2,250-4,500 rpm, with the characteristic Bentley “torque plateau” delivering the effortless wave of acceleration that’s a constant of Bentley performance.The engine isn’t just more powerful than its predecessors – it’s also more characterful. As standard the Bentayga Speed is fitted with a Sports exhaust system, which delivers a rich, powerful engine note that complements the eager character of the High Powered V8 and promotes a deep sense of driver engagement. This exhaust can be distinguished externally by two elliptical tailpipes emerging through the rear diffuser. For an even more thrilling soundtrack, the optional Titanium Akrapovic Exhaust accentuates the power, drama and potency of the V8, with its aural expression of the performance that awaits at the merest flex of the throttle. This system features quad tailpipes. Of the three driving modes available to drivers of the new Bentayga Speed, both COMFORT and BENTLEY modes remain unchanged in calibration compared with other Bentayga models, to retain exceptional day-to-day and grand touring competency. SPORT mode however is significantly enhanced, delivering increased steering response, roadholding and driver connection, enhanced by a 15% increase in suspension damping stiffness. Enhanced SPORT mode enables the driver to exploit the power of the V8 engine more fully when cornering and to experience the exceptionally agile turn-in capabilities of brake torque vectoring.For the ultimate in braking capability and driver engagement, optional carbon ceramic brakes allow the selection of ESC Dynamic in SPORT mode, which relaxes ESC intervention to permit exhilarating drift angles or power-on oversteer where appropriate. Torque vectoring by brake allows for a sharper turn-in, and more power to be put to the road during corner exit – with improved driver confidence going hand-in-hand with the extra agility. Also included in ESC Dynamic programming is Launch Control, a first for any Bentayga model.The Bentayga Speed now includes all-wheel steering. At low and medium speeds, the rear wheels are steered in the opposite direction to the front wheels to aid a rapid change of direction, noticeably increasing the feeling of agility and reducing the turning circle. The steering feels sharper, and a commensurate increase in steering feel provides greater driver confidence. At high speeds, the rear wheels steer in the same direction as the front, to improve stability. Taken together, the new SPORT mode enhancements, optional carbon ceramic brakes, ESC Dynamic software and all-wheel steering set new levels of agility, roadholding and driver engagement. As the performance flagship of the line-up, Bentayga Speed simply recalibrates all one’s expectations of handling, roadholding, acceleration and steering response for a luxury SUV.Distinctive exterior features of the new Bentayga Speed include dark tint brightware, bright chrome Speed badges on the leading edge of the front doors, and 22” Speed wheels in either dark tint or silver (the latter being a no cost option). Unique Speed headlamps feature dark tint internals and a dark tint bezel, while tail lamps are grey, again with a dark tint bezel. For the first time in Bentley’s history, a 23” Speed wheel is optionally available when carbon ceramic brakes are specified, and these come in a choice of grey satin, black or black and bright machined finishes. Painted calipers in a choice of seven striking colours are also available standard brakes and when choosing the carbon ceramic brake option.Another option offered exclusively for the Bentayga Speed is the Speed black roof, which is finished in either gloss or satin, depending on the chosen body finish. The black roof, which includes the lower section of the tailgate spoiler, makes a powerful, assertive visual impact.The interior design of the Bentayga Speed reflects its singular performance focus. Standard features include the Speed-specific driver information display, Speed badging to the passenger fascia and treadplates, and Speed embroidered emblem on the seat uppers. The familiar Bentley ‘bullseye’ air vents, organ stops, and central air vents can be finished in dark tint as well as the standard chrome. Seat shoulder panels, door inners and backboard (four-seat models) all feature a new Precision Diamond quilt design. For the upholstery, the Speed colour split features a darker secondary hide as the predominant colour, relieved by flashes of the main hide colour on seat outers, door and the instrument panel side cheeks.The new Bentayga Speed offers an extraordinary breadth of capabilities, with COMFORT and BENTLEY modes offering the perfect blend of pace, refinement, and relaxation for most driving conditions. Select SPORT mode however, and a new, more visceral and thrilling side to its character emerges. Through careful chassis enhancements and the adoption of the new High Powered 4.0 V8, Bentley’s engineers have created the most powerful and dynamic Bentayga ever, without losing an iota of what makes a Bentley, a Bentley."

            "article": "McLaren Automotive celebrates the 30th anniversary of its winning debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans – completing a unique Triple Crown* achievement - and McLaren’s return to the top class of the event from 2027. With just 50 cars being built, the 750S Le Mans is set to be one of the most sought-after McLaren series production supercars.On June 18, 1995 McLaren F1 GTR #59 - driven by JJ Lehto, Yannick Dalmas and Masanori Sekiya - won the gruelling 24-hour race, joined by three more McLaren F1 GTRs in the top five placings. Just days before the 30th anniversary, two McLaren GT3 EVO cars – based on the 750S - will compete for LMGT3 honours at this year’s edition of the endurance classic.The McLaren 750S Le Mans pays homage to the iconic #59 F1 GTR with matching Le Mans Grey exterior paint – with the option of McLaren Orange also available - roof scoop and 5-spoke LM wheels. It will also feature the new MSO High Downforce Kit (HDK), which adds visual drama to the 750S with a raised carbon fibre Active Rear Spoiler with integral endplates. In conjunction with a front bumper featuring an enlarged carbon fibre splitter and rear wing, downforce is increased by 10 per cent compared to the standard 750S, enhancing track performance and echoing the famous McLaren F1 LM edition’s aerodynamic additions. Completing the HDK package is a new body-coloured carbon fibre under-wing panel featuring gloss black louvres.McLaren 750S Le Mans customers will also have a choice of Carbon Black with Dove Grey or Carbon Black with McLaren Orange interior colour combinations with Le Mans branding and a dedication plaque, with all cars featuring a portfolio of unique features as standard:InteriorChoice of two exterior paint themes: Le Mans Grey or McLaren OrangeHigh Downforce Kit (HDK) front bumper with enlarged Carbon Fibre Splitter in Gloss Black, Raised Carbon Fibre Active Rear Spoiler in Gloss Black and Louvred Body Colour Carbon Fibre Under-Wing Panel with Gloss Black Louvres5-spoke Le Mans wheel with Stealth finish and Le Mans brandingF1 Gold Special Colour Brake Calipers with red McLaren logoWheel Centre Caps with blue/red colour detailGloss Black Carbon Fibre Roof ScoopCarbon Fibre Front Fenders with Gloss Black LouvresGloss Black exterior detailsNatural Titanium Exhaust FinisherPainted Le Mans exterior brandingExteriorChoice of two unique Le Mans interior themes; Carbon Black Alcantara with Jet Black Softgrain Leather and Dove Grey Alcantara or Carbon Black Alcantara with Jet Black Softgrain Leather and McLaren Orange AlcantaraLe Mans debossed headrest brandingLe Mans branded floormatsBespoke Le Mans dedication plaqueIn addition, a range of options are available exclusively to 750S Le Mans customers, including:Exterior Details in Gloss Visual Carbon Fibre, including the Hood Air Intakes, Door Mirror Casings, Side Air Intakes, Rear Fender Air Intakes and Raised Active Rear Spoiler EndplatesGloss Visual Carbon Fibre HDK and Underbody pack, including the Front Splitter, Rear Diffuser and Raised Active Rear SpoilerGloss Visual Carbon Fibre Raised Active Rear Spoiler onlyGloss Visual Carbon Fibre Louvre pack including the Front Fender Louvres and Rear Under-Wing Panel LouvresGloss Visual Carbon Fibre Roof Scoop OuterTrack Brake Upgrade incorporating F1 Gold Special Colour Brake Calipers with red McLaren logoAn optional track record plaque lists the 1995 Le Mans victory, with Triple Crown* achievements also featured alongside McLaren’s many significant motorsport successes. Mounted in the front luggage compartment, this option is available to purchasers of all new 750S cars.Purchasers of the Le Mans edition cars will also benefit from the multi-award winning** benchmark-beating 750S performance delivered by the mid-mounted, 750PS M840T 4.0-litre, twin-turbocharged V8 McLaren engine. A motorsport-inspired carbon fibre Monocage II central structure and Proactive Chassis Control III suspension system help to ensure that the 750S is the lightest and most agile car in its class, now enhanced by the HDK aerodynamic additions.“The 750S Le Mans marks not just 30 years since our debut victory in the iconic race but an exciting time for the brand with McLaren GT3 EVO cars competing in this year’s race and the announcement of our return to the top, Hypercar class in 2027.This exclusive 750S is the first McLaren Le Mans edition since the F1 LM to feature HDK aerodynamic enhancements and is set to become one of our most sought-after supercars, with previous Le Mans editions of the 650S and 720S commanding a premium over standard models.” Henrik Wilhelmsmeyer, Chief Commercial Officer, McLaren Automotive"

            "article": "The Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este once again proves to be the ideal stage for the world premiere of a new concept by Atelier Zagato, paying tribute to one of the most iconic names in the history of Italian automotive tradition: the Alfa Romeo 8C.The historic collaboration between Alfa Romeo and Zagato dates back to 1921, with the debut of the Tipo G1, and continued under the technical direction of Vittorio Jano through the entire 6C range. It reached a legendary turning point in the 30s, a true golden age, with the arrival of the 8C model. Built for competition, the various versions produced between 1931 and 1939 achieved distinction in all of the most prestigious races of the era—from the Mille Miglia to the Targa Florio, Spa-Francorchamps, the Nürburgring, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.A total of 195 Alfa Romeo 8Cs—both road and racing versions—were produced, built on three chassis types: LM (Lungo – Le Mans), MM (Medio or Mille Miglia), and M (Corto or Monza), plus a special series created for Scuderia Ferrari, all bodied by Zagato.Following the 2023 debut of the Giulia SWB, a tribute to the 6C mechanical heritage, Atelier Zagato had long aspired to celebrate the 8C lineage as well.The synergy with a visionary Italian collector made this new milestone possible, resulting in the creation of a Concept Car entirely designed and built in-house by the Milanese Atelier, based on the mechanical platform of the 8C Competizione. This new project adds the final missing link to Zagato’s modern interpretations of the most legendary Alfa Romeo models.The Alfa Romeo 8C DoppiaCoda Zagato is both a historical homage and a visionary concept. Beyond reaffirming Zagato’s authorship of the short-wheelbase or “Monza” 8C bodywork, this new creation fuses two of the Milanese Atelier’s most distinctive design codes: the Kamm-tail (Coda Tronca) and the rounded tail, brought together in an entirely new and character-defining rear-end design.“We may have just started a new chapter in Zagato design, focused on researching tail sections and exploring new aerodynamic and stylistic solutions to spark innovation—just like coachbuilders always used to do.With the AGTZ Twin Tail project in 2024, we explored the concept of a single car convertible between short-tail and long-tail configurations, effectively offering two cars in one. With the 8C DoppiaCoda, instead, we created a true fusion of round and truncated tails into a single body style—one that still preserves the functional benefits of both.” — Andrea Michele Zagato, President of Zagato.“It may sound abstract to say that beauty and function are inherent in one form, but it is not that complicated. However, it is quite difficult to embody this in the overall complex machine that is an automobile, and yet Alfa Romeo and Zagato have continued to do so for over 100 years, refining it and, as a result, being loved by many proving that the culture of beauty and performance is alive in mobility.For this reason, Alfa Romeo cars designed by Zagato must embody timeless values, blending function and beauty while preserving the distinctive form and identity that each brand has cultivated over a century of history. When I draw a side view of a car, I sometimes imagine it rippling through the air. While at times it can be strong and dramatic like a Beethoven concerto, this car is a harmonious, repeating wave, like a Bach cantata. And cutting off that wave at the rear is Zagato’s traditional Coda Tronca.The sharp line flowing from the front wheel arch rises at the rear fender and continues toward the rear wing. But instead of fading softly, this surface is intentionally cut off almost vertically. Seen from behind, the wing forms a ring, giving the impression it is set into the tail of the car. In this way, the wing is completely detached from the body, yet appears to be part of it from the side.The Coda Tronca is a design solution traditionally used in extreme, race-inspired sports cars. But if applied directly to a high-class GT like the 8C, the tail would have felt visually heavy. That’s why this “wing tronca” was developed specifically for this car.” — Norihiko Harada, Chief Designer at Zagato."

It can be summed up as follows: a racing car in a suit.To offer the best in electric propulsion, Alpine's engineers and developers have created a set of three electric motors (one at the front, two at the rear) that form an AWD system (a first for Alpine) and enable the development of the Alpine Active Torque Vectoring* system, which enhances dynamism, safety and agility. It is a level of sophistication usually reserved for higher segments. Here, the driving experience is the priority even more than pure performance. The A390 is designed to deliver its performance unabated in the most demanding conditions, whether climbing mountain passes or even on the racetrack. * active torque distributionThe A390 is the second model in Alpine's Dream Garage, following the A290 and preceding the future A110, which will also be 100% electric. It will expand the brand's customer base by attracting new buyers and appealing to professional customers.

            "article": "The new BMW M2 CS further raises the bar for sheer driving pleasure at the premium end of the compact high-performance sports car segment. Outstanding agility, a significant increase in power, supreme dynamics, and design details inspired by Motorsport make driving the latest special edition model from BMW M an exhilarating and intensely rewarding experience. The new BMW M2 CS is the next chapter in an unqualified success story, which began with the iconic BMW 2002 Turbo and continued with the BMW 1 Series M Coupe and the first BMW M2 – including the first CS variant, unveiled in 2019. BMW M offered a first glimpse of the exterior design of the BMW M2 CS on May 23rd at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on the shores of Lake Como.The latest CS model offers the ultimate in driving pleasure – both as a track tool and in day-to-day use. The BMW M2 CS will be assembled at BMW Group Plant San Luis Potosí in Mexico starting in August 2025. And like other special models from BMW M, the M2 CS will be produced in limited numbers. The market launch will begin in late summer 2025.The new BMW M2 CS is based on the second generation of the BMW M2 and builds on what is already an extraordinary level of performance. For example, the high-revving inline 6-cylinder engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology develops an impressive 523 hp in the M2 CS – 50 more than in the standard BMW M2. The M2 CS sends its power to the rear wheels via a standard 8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic.With the M2 CS, BMW M has reduced the weight of the standard 8-speed Steptronic-equipped M2 by 97 pounds. This was achieved through judicious use of lightweight materials, such as exterior and interior components made from carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) and fitting the M2 CS with forged M alloy wheels as standard.For duty in the BMW M2 CS, BMW M has upgraded the 3.0-liter S58 inline 6-cylinder engine found in the standard M2, intensfying an already exceptional performance experience, particularly in highly dynamic driving situations. Their work further sharpens the engine’s remarkable power characteristics and perfectly accentuates the linear power delivery – sustained into the higher reaches of the rev range – familiar in BMW M models. Compared to the standard BMW M2 with the 8-speed M Steptronic transmission, maximum torque has been raised by 36 lb-ft to 479 and is available across a broad rev range – between 2,700 and 5,620 rpm. The engine produces its maximum power of 523 hp at 6,250 rpm and redlines at 7,200 rpm. And the accelerator mapping and response have been optimized in all drive modes to deliver seemingly instantaneous responses to the driver’s inputs.This enhanced performance is achieved by modifying the engine management and provides further proof of the outstanding potential of the S58 6-cylinder engine developed by BMW M, which also serves as the basis for the power unit used in the BMW M4 GT3 EVO racing car. The engine’s M TwinPower Turbo technology comprises a pair of mono-scroll turbochargers, each feeding three cylinders, an indirect intercooler supplied by a low-temperature circuit, and an electronically controlled wastegate. The technology package also includes High Precision Injection, VALVETRONIC variable valve timing, and Double-VANOS fully variable camshaft timing. The engine also has an array of details borrowed directly from racing design that contribute to its lightning-fast response, appetite for revs, and high-performance capability in track use. These details include an extremely rigid crankcase with a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction, a forged crankshaft with lightweight design, cylinder bores with a wire-arc sprayed iron coating, and a 3D-printed core for the cylinder head.The M-specific cooling system ensures the powertrain components maintain an optimal operating temperature even under heavy loads, and the oil circuit is designed to handle extreme dynamic driving situations. A map-controlled oil pump ensures reliable oil supply even under extreme acceleration.The engine sends its drive power to the rear wheels through an 8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. The Drivelogic button integrated into the selector lever makes it possible to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics, with a choice of three clearly distinguishable settings. Both the selector lever in the latest M design and the gearshift paddles on the steering wheel enable the driver to change gears manually if desired.A model-specific engine mounting with a higher spring rate makes for a more rigid connection of the drive unit to the structure of the BMW M2 CS. The extremely direct transmission of power to the drivetrain optimizes response. Thanks to the lightning-fast power delivery, in combination with the increased engine power and the reduction in weight, the BMW M2 CS is able to sprint from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.7 seconds – 0.2 seconds quicker than the standard Steptronic-equipped M2. The mid-range sprint from 50-75 mph takes 3.4 seconds. Top speed with the standard M Driver’s Package is electronically limited to 188 mph. The dynamic power delivery is backed by an emotionally rich engine note from the M-specific exhaust system with electrically controlled flaps and four exhaust tips characteristic of M, which are finished in matte black on the BMW M2 CS.The chassis technology and braking system in the BMW M2 CS are precisely tailored to the improved performance characteristics of the engine and the specific weight balance of the M2 CS. The chassis has been lowered by 0.2 in and adapted specially for the CS with unique tuning of the springs, dampers, and chassis control systems. These modifications improve driving dynamics significantly in all scenarios – including under extremely hard driving. Indeed, the settings for the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and M Dynamic Mode have been optimized precisely to meet the demands of driving on a track. The standard Adaptive M Suspension has been given a revised, model-specific setup, as have the M Servotronic steering, M Sport differential, and the integrated braking system. Standard M Compound brakes with red calipers provide authoritative stopping power. M Carbon ceramic brakes with red brake cllipers are available as an option ($8,500). Standard equipment also includes CS-exclusive Style 827M forged alloy wheels with a double-spoke design and matte Gold Bronze finish. Measuring 19-inches at the front and 20-inches at the rear, the wheels are fitted as standard with high performance tires sized 275/35 ZR19 front and 285/30 ZR20 rear. Track tires and ultra-track tires are available optionally at no cost.The exterior of the BMW M2 CS underscores its high performance mission with CFRP components and exclusive details that set it apart. It boasts the signature M exterior mirror caps, a standard M Carbon roof, and a CS-specific rear diffuser, all crafted from exposed carbon fiber. Adding to the sporty and dynamic appearance are a matte black front splitter and a unique black BMW M kidney grille with optimized air inlets. The lightweight CFRP trunk lid with integrated ducktail spoiler is emblazoned with a striking “M2 CS” logo featuring a bold red border.Four colors are available for the exterior finish of the new BMW M2 CS: Black Sapphire metallic, Brooklyn Grey metallic, and Portimao Blue metallic are available at no extra cost, and BMW Individual Velvet Blue metallic is optionally available at a price of $3,600. Adaptive LED Headlights with Shadowline dark inlays are also standard.The interior of the new BMW M2 CS surrounds the occupants in a performance-focused environment combining the sporty feel of exquisite Alcantara with innovative lightweight design. The driver and passenger are supported by weight-optimized, heated M Carbon bucket seats with illuminated “CS” logos. The integrated head restraints are removable for helmet clearance and, thanks to the option of integrating multi-point harnesses, improve the M2 CS’s track readiness. The surfaces of the seats are finished exclusively in Black Merino leather with M Color highlights.With a flat-bottomed rim, gearshift paddles, a red center marker at 12 o’clock, and two M buttons for selecting individually configured vehicle setups, the standard heated M Alcantara steering wheel features a traditional three-spoke design and brings Motorsport flair to the cockpit. The trim elements in the instrument panel and center console are finished in carbon fiber. Additional details include a red “CS” logo on the carbon fiber center console, M seatbelts, black threshold plates with an “M2 CS” logo and red outline. Now illuminated with the “CS” logo, the door trim panels certainly grab the attention. The color of the lighting used here can be set individually with the standard ambient lighting. When switched off, a carbon structure is visible. Rounding off the sporty interior is the M Anthracite headlining.Standard equipment in the new BMW M2 CS also includes automatic climate control, comfort access, a Harman Kardon Surround Sound System, and BMW Live Cockpit Professional, including the BMW Maps navigation system. As well as the BMW Head-Up Display, it also includes Augmented View on the control display. The standard smartphone integration allows wireless use of Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™. The M-specific displays on the BMW Curved Display and BMW Head-Up Display add to the progressive sports car flair in the cockpit. The fully-digital display grouping consists of a 12.3-inch information display and a 14.9-inch control display. These serve as a platform for the BMW iDrive control and operation system, based on BMW Operating System 8.5, which can also be used to digitally operate the climate control functions. In the BMW M2 CS, temperature and ventilation settings, heated seats, and the heated steering wheel can be controlled either by touch using a special menu option in the lower area of the control display or by voice command with the help of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.The CS carries over the cutting-edge operating concept for setup customization from the standard BMW M2. At the heart is the Setup button on the center console. This provides direct access to the settings options for the engine, Adaptive M Suspension, M Servotronic steering, integrated braking system working in conjunction with the M Compound brakes, and the M Traction Control function, which allows drivers to choose from ten individual intervention thresholds for wheel slip limitation. The M Drift Analyzer shows the angle and duration of drifts executed by the driver, while the M Laptimer is ideal for those striving for the perfect lap.Semi-automated driving and parking systems fitted as standard include Forward Collision Mitigation, Active Cruise Control with Distance Control, Speed Limit Info, Lane Keeping Assistant, and the Parking Assistant."

            "article": "The name Bovensiepen is by no means new to the automotive world. Today, it stands for a manufacturer of exceptional vehicles that embody the concept of fine driving.The launch of the Bovensiepen brand at FuoriConcorso marks a new era for the company — a continuation of its decades-long engineering and design excellence, combined with the craftsmanship and taste of a family-run atelier like Zagato, which shares the same core values. The result is a debut model that perfectly merges German engineering with Italian design sensibility.Gran Turismo is more than just a category — it’s a way of life. And it’s from this tradition that the first Bovensiepen model is born. The Bovensiepen Zagato combines Bavarian engineering with Italian design signed by Zagato, creating a contemporary GT that is both elegant and full of character.“Our goal is to build cars for connoisseurs and enthusiasts who appreciate the perfect symbiosis of design and technology.” - Andreas Bovensiepen, CEO Bovensiepen AutomobilesMore than just a fusion of design and technology, the new Bovensiepen Zagato is a tangible expression of collaboration between Engineering made in Bavaria and Design made in Milan.The design bears the unmistakable Milanese signature: elegant proportions, a long bonnet, the iconic Double Bubble roof, sculpted volumes, and refined details such as the stainless steel front grille, fully retractable frameless windows, integrated rear spoiler, and aerodynamic air outlet.“It’s a kind of blend of Italian charm, sensual and soft design, with a very solid, almost architectural German structure… a beautiful fusion of two automotive cultures.”- Norihiko Harada, Chief Designer Zagato“The art of coachbuilding was born in Milan over 500 years ago. Atelier Zagato has been operating for 106 years in collaboration with the most prestigious automotive brands. Designing the first car for a newly born marque is a tradition we are proud to continue. This project with the Bovensiepen family is particularly special, as it continues the legacy of blending Zagato DNA with that of a new and inspiring brand, starting from its very first creation.” - Andrea Michele Zagato, President of ZagatoUnderscoring the strong connection with Milanese coachbuilding tradition is the use of the patronymic badge, historically employed by Atelier Zagato since the 1920s to sign cars built in partnership with manufacturers such as Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Isotta Fraschini, and Rolls Royce.Each Bovensiepen Zagato requires over 250 hours of labor and the assembly of more than 400 custom components, entrusted to skilled craftsmen."

            "article": "At the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2025, the renowned celebration of historic vehicles on the shores of Lake Como in Italy, the BMW Group is presenting an exclusive new concept car that will subsequently be made available for purchase in a small series.The BMW Concept Speedtop reimagines the sporty Touring, blending the elegance of a shooting brake with unique proportions. \"A true BMW exudes dynamism and elegance even when it’s standing still,\" says Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design. \"And that’s also the case with our new concept car. The BMW Concept Speedtop is characterised first of all by its profile. It is very unique in the automotive industry. In this way, we have created an exclamation mark for our entire lineup of vehicles, especially for the Touring models.\"The generous interior invites for weekend getaways for two. High-quality materials, the focus on every detail, and the stylistic connection between exterior and interior are a testament for its true craftsmanship.The BMW Concept Speedtop shares its eye-catching form language with the BMW Skytop and will be offered to collectors and connoisseurs in a strictly limited small series.The pronounced V-shape of the front end, with its shark-nose design, the slim front lights and the illuminated kidney grille give the BMW Concept Speedtop an unmistakable presence. The continuation of the central spline from the bonnet over the roof to the rear spoiler gives the car a dynamic Touring profile. The colour gradient on the roof, moving from “Floating Sunstone Maroon” to “Floating Sundown Silver”, accentuates this shape. The athletic design is enhanced by the car’s broad shoulders. Its elegance is underscored by two-tone, 14-spoke wheels, which have been designed specifically for the BMW Concept Speedtop.The interior of the BMW Concept Speedtop was designed with a strong focus to even the smallest detail. Skillfully crafted, traditional brogue-style details accentuate the leather-trimmed surfaces and emphasise the manufactory-level craftmanship on display. The two-tone colour and material concept creates a connection between the exterior and interior. The sparkling brown tone of the “Floating Sunstone Maroon” exterior paint is carried over into the interior. Here, the brown \"Sundown Maroon\" world harmonises with the light \"Moonstone White\" of the seats. The two-tone leather upholstery divides the dynamic and functional areas of the interior. The visually striking roof spline in the exterior is mirrored as a light beam in the two-tone leather headliner, providing an atmospheric, indirect illumination. The trunk is also leather-covered and refined with brogue-style perforations. A light beam illuminates the luggage compartment, which is divided into two sections. This allows large items of luggage to be stowed inside for multi-day trips. The elaborate craftsmanship in the exterior and interior was realised with the expertise of the Manufactory workshop at the BMW Group plant in Dingolfing.The virtuosity in the design of the BMW Concept Speedtop is further enhanced through the collaboration with the traditional Italian manufacturer Schedoni. Known for the production of exclusive and high-quality leather goods by hand, especially in the automotive sector, Schedoni has always stood for highest quality and customisation. Two storage areas with leather straps behind the seats provide space for two of Schedoni’s made-to-measure bags. The bags were designed exclusively for the Concept to fit in with its colour and material concept. A matching weekend bag can also be accommodated in the trunk.The concept car’s engine ensures it scales the heights not only in terms of design, but also performance. It is fitted with the most powerful V8 engine currently offered by BMW.\"Last year, the presentation of the BMW Concept Skytop at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on Lake Como generated great enthusiasm among connoisseurs and automotive enthusiasts,\" says Bernd Körber, Senior Vice President BMW Brand and Product Management. \"This led to a strictly limited production run of 50 units. Thanks to this positive response, this year we have decided to also offer the BMW Concept Speedtop in a limited production series of 70 units. This extraordinary vehicle is now available for order. We are pleased to be able to offer collectors and enthusiasts another exclusive model.\""

            "article": "Aston Martin is proud to announce the arrival of a new DBX flagship, DBX S. With the dynamic appeal of DBX707 and an engine enhanced by technology transferred directly from the forthcoming Valhalla supercar, DBX S offers one of the most engaging and responsive driving experiences delivering even more power, reduced weight and more assertive design. With a suite of exterior and interior enhancements to match, the DBX S certainly has its own undeniable identity.DBX S continues a long tradition of Aston Martin’s utilising the ‘S’ suffix to denote a special, high-performance version of an existing model; the first being Vanquish S which made its public debut at the Paris Motor Show in 2004. DBX S proves that lighter variants with more power and performance are still very much part of Aston Martin’s core production offering and looks to continue a lineage of notable high performing models.Aston Martin CEO, Adrian Hallmark, said ‘Over the last two years, Aston Martin have introduced an entire core collection of next generation sports cars as well as a new DBX; all with a new, entirely bespoke infotainment system designed in-house. The marque continues its focus on class leading performance, ultra-luxury design and innovation, broadening the range of products under each core model. The introduction of DBX S not only reaffirms our commitment to producing the most exciting, rewarding and beautiful cars, it also sends a powerful statement of intent about our ambitions not just for DBX, but for the Aston Martin brand.”At the heart of the new DBX S lies an upgraded version of the acclaimed Aston Martin 4.0-Litre Twin-Turbo V8 powerhouse. By using turbo technology transferred directly from the upcoming Valhalla supercar including its larger compressor wheel diameters and other internal improvements, power is raised by a further 20PS to 727PS and provides even greater urgency at the very top of the rev range, making DBX S’s performance even more memorable. The result is a 0-62mph time of just 3.3 seconds and reduction in acceleration time from 0-124mph (200km/h) of 0.3 seconds. Top speed remains unchanged at an impressive 193mph.Further enhancing both performance and its perception is a modified exhaust system amplifying even more character to the natural voice of the thunderous V8 engine and exploiting the full the opportunity presented by the engine’s turbo enhancements.As with its DBX707 stablemate, DBX S distributes its power between the front and rear wheels in variable proportion – including an ability to send 50 per cent of its torque to the front and up to 100 per cent of its torque to the rear wheels alone - through an innovative 9-speed ‘wet clutch’ transmission, which removes the need for a conventional torque converter, delivering extreme performance on launch from standstill. However, the DBX S gearbox has been further modified to provide an even more memorable driving experience. Change up points are adjusted to reflect the car’s extended rev range, while downshifts in Sport and Sport + modes when the car is in automatic are even more aggressive.In addition to the power upgrade, a number of measures have been taken not only to significantly reduce the kerb weight of DBX S, but to do so in an intelligent and highly selective fashion that ensures that mere weight loss is just one of attributes resulting from these actions. A prime example is the new optional carbon fibre roof presented in a glorious single weave pattern which, at almost three metres square, is by far the largest such carbon element ever fitted to an Aston Martin. Specification of the carbon roof sees the removal of the roof rails, and as a combination not only saves 18kg of mass, but does so from the very highest point of the car, reducing its centre of gravity and therefore enhancing both stability and agility further.Magnesium wheels are also now available as an option for the first time on any car in the SUV segment. Magnesium is not only robust, but an incredibly lightweight material, some 75 per cent lighter than steel; half the weight of titanium and a third less even than aluminium. In selecting this 23” optional wheel, a further 19kg of unsprung mass is saved, delivering improvements in ride quality, steering precision and feel, as well the car’s more immediate reaction to direction input. DBX S is also available to order with 23” forged aluminium wheels as standard.Specifying the magnesium wheels also sees the deletion of roof rails, offering a further weight savings. Additionally, customers can also specify a bespoke a lightweight polycarbonate honeycomb grille, intricately designed with over 25,000 individual facets which all helps shift the weight distribution rearward, aiding both handling and the car’s traction capabilities.Steering ratio on DBX S is also faster by only 4 per cent but noticeably improves agility making the car feel even more sporting and responsive while stopping well short of introducing any sense of nervousness into its handling. It also reduces the turning circle by almost half a metre to just 12.0 metres, improving the urban driving experience.DBX S benefits from the full suite of suspension enhancements introduced last year, which saw a revised calibration of both the air springs and electronic dampers, increasing transient body control in order to reduce weight transference and therefore improve primary ride quality and overall stability. Even right at the limit, its standard electronic roll control means the DBX S rolls by no more 1.5 degrees; enough to create the natural feel of the car cornering but still keeping the car flatter than many purpose built, two seat sports cars. The spring rate also changes depending upon selected drive mode, actively moving the roll stiffness balance through a corner to enhance grip and steering response. Near inexhaustible braking performance is provided by mighty carbon ceramic disc brakes at each corner, measuring no less than 420mm at the front and 390mm at the back.Visually, the Aston Martin design team have ensured that no one who sees DBX S will be left in any doubt they’re looking at the most sporting, dynamically capable and enthralling ultra-luxury SUV on the market.From the front, the new DBX S is instantly recognisable by its pure black vaned grille, giving this edition immediate road presence, whilst the lightweight polycarbonate grille with a honeycomb design taking cues from DBS 770 Ultimate, is also available to specify as an option. A new splitter and diffuser further enhance the car’s naturally assertive presence alongside the distinctive wraparound daytime running light design.Seen from the side, new sills boast highly distinctive up-turned air splitters which in typical Aston Martin fashion exist for function as much as form, helping channel and direct the airflow along the side of the car. Carbon fibre is available to specify for the wing mirrors, side strakes and lower door sill, while distinctive ‘S’ signature badging on the front fenders marks the true nature of this beast. Like the iconic Aston Martin wings, these badges are manufactured in solid metal, glass enamelled with the ‘S ‘infilled in red as it appeared on previous models such as the V12 Vantage S and the Rapide S. The badge surround is then chrome plated in either the bright or dark chrome to match the colour of the wings chosen by the customer.The most obvious visual changes to the new flagship DBX are at the rear, dominated by quad exhausts now vertically stacked and available in both gloss and matt finishes, giving full voice to the glorious sound of the V8 at maximum attack. The rear bumper and diffuser have been completely reprofiled and, along with the side sills and wing, can be specified with carbon to reduce overall vehicle mass by a further 7kg. DBX S also showcases a new lower livery design available to specify in 3 colours; Rosso Corsa Red, Trophy Silver and Podium Green. The sporting livery highlights the front splitter, diffuser and side sills continuing to the rear, framing the new stacked quad exhausts.The interior of DBX S displays a bespoke ‘S’ theme; the most notable feature being the distinctive herringbone design which comes as standard on the seats, but which is also extended to the headlining if the optional Carbon roof is chosen. The herringbone lines become increasingly wider as they progress up the seat, giving an unmistakeable impression of speed; fitting for the highest performing SUV in the marques range.DBX S is trimmed as standard in lightweight sporting Alcantara, which can be seen on the seats, headlining, centre console, lower instrument panels and upper trim. In areas of high wear such as the seat bolsters, the Alcantara is seamlessly blended with semi-aniline leather. For those who prefer an even greater sense of luxury, DBX S can be trimmed entirely in semi-aniline leather. Red seatbelts can also be specified to bring additional ‘S’ identification inside the car.The ‘S’ suffix is embroidered onto the seat, complimented by the Aston Martin wings that are emblazoned on the headrests with an industry-first technique using both embossing and debossing with extreme pressure (1.5 tonnes) and heat to sculpt the wings into the leather in sub-millimetre precision and detail. Furthermore the ‘S’ appears on the treadplates and engine plaque to complete the picture.DBX S continues the adoption of Aston Martin’s state-of-the-art in-house developed infotainment system with a striking new cabin architecture. This transformative enhancement showcases exemplary deployment of craft and innovation combining immaculate design and indulgent luxury with a formidable suite of connected car technology.It is also fitted with the Aston Martin Premium Audio 800w 14 speaker audio system as standard. Developed utilising advanced hardware, this system features a surround sound mode with QuantumLogic® surround sound processing for a totally immersive soundscape. However, true audio enthusiasts will delight in the optional system developed with Aston Martin’s audio partner, Bowers & Wilkins. Acoustically engineered to the interior volume and shape of DBX S, this exceptional system uses technologies and innovations found in Bowers & Wilkins acclaimed world-class loudspeakers. Aluminium Double Dome tweeters and Continuum® midrange speakers give this 23-speaker, double amplified 1,600W surround sound system a balanced and accurate sound. Dedicated 3D headline speakers, bass speakers and a powerful subwoofer deliver a powerful and dynamic sound experience, reflecting the characteristics of DBX S itself.‘S’ has long had an association with Aston Martin, and DBX S proves that lighter variants with more power and performance are still very much part of the marque’s story, and are set to last into the foreseeable future. DBX S is available to order now, with deliveries expected in Q4 2025."

            "article": "Ferrari has presented its latest special version model, the 296 Speciale, a mid-rear engined plug-in hybrid berlinetta. This car takes its rightful place in the exclusive lineage of special version Ferrari berlinettas and, just like its forebears – the Challenge Stradale, 430 Scuderia, 458 Speciale and 488 Pista – has been conceived to set the new benchmark in terms of driving thrills and engagement, not just for the marque’s production range, but for the segment as a whole.The astonishing capabilities of the 296 Speciale in terms of agility, turn-in responsiveness and stability set it apart. This special version not only multiplies the already extraordinary performance of the 296 GTB but also introduces a sense of predictability and intuitiveness that makes this a car unlike any other. Conceived for the Ferrarista who demands an unrivalled driving experience, the 296 Speciale represents the new pinnacle for the Ferrari production range in terms of driving fun and is dedicated to owners in search of that special feeling of being at the wheel of a car with extraordinary performance.The 296 Speciale takes the agility and responsiveness of the 296 GTB to extreme new heights by exploiting the full potential of its plug-in hybrid architecture, consisting of a rear-mid 120° V6 twin turbo engine and an electric motor, a short wheelbase and innovative dynamic control systems. The drivetrain delivers an astonishing combined power output of 880 hp, 50 more than the 296 GTB and a record for a rear-wheel-drive production Ferrari.To make these results possible, Ferrari drew extensively from its experience in motor sports: the internal combustion engine borrows from the powerplant of the 296 Challenge in terms of engine management maps and boost strategy, and boasts titanium connecting rods, reinforced pistons and a lightened crankshaft. All these elements, together with a knock control system derived from Formula 1, have raised the power output of the V6 to 700 cv, 37 more than the model this special version is based on. The V6 engine of the 296 Speciale maintains its distinctive timbre, a sound consisting of the pure harmonics of the 3rd, 6th, and 9th combustion orders which, in this application, have gained in quality, intensity and volume.The electric motor has also been uprated and is now capable of delivering 180 cv in the new extra boost mode. This increase in power has also made it possible to introduce a new strategy for the eight-speed DCT transmission, which makes use of additional torque during shifts to shorten shift times and increase both performance and driver engagement.The 296 Speciale generates 435 kg of downforce at 250 km/h - 20% more than the 296 GTB - thanks to innovative solutions developed and tested on the 296 Challenge. These include the aero damper integrated into the front bonnet and the vertical fins on the rear bumper which incorporate new side wings that work in synergy with the active rear spoiler to generate additional downforce. The spoiler is now managed by a new actuator control strategy that not only shortens the transition time between Low Drag (LD) and High Downforce (HD) configurations by 50% but also introduces a new Medium Downforce (MD) configuration, which improves rear-end stability at high speeds.A great deal of attention was dedicated to saving weight, which is crucial for increasing driving thrills. Overall weight has been reduced by 60 kg compared with the 296 GTB by using materials such as carbon fibre for some of the bodyshell parts and titanium for components in the engine. The resulting weight/power ratio is just 1.60 kg/cv, a record for a rear-wheel-drive Ferrari berlinetta.To accentuate the dynamic capabilities of the 296 Speciale and ensure that the car behaves predictably when driven at the limit, Ferrari’s engineers also worked on fine-tuning the electronic control systems, suspension set-up and tyres. The 296 Speciale is equipped with the latest generation of the ABS Evo dynamic control system, which improves braking precision and repeatability in all surface and grip conditions. The spring and damper settings have been revised – the car now rides 5 mm lower than the 296 GTB – reducing maximum roll angle when cornering by 13% and improving the behaviour of the car at the limit."

            "article": "Ferrari has presented its latest special version model, the 296 Speciale A, a mid-rear engined plug-in hybrid spider. The car joins the Scuderia Spider 16M, the 458 Speciale A, and the 488 Pista Spider, an ultra-exclusive dynasty of special versions of Ferrari’s berlinetta-derived spiders, and aims to become the new benchmark of the range - as well as the market - in terms of top-down driving thrills.The 296 Speciale A adds the retractable hardtop (RHT) to the coupé’s incredible qualities of agile handling, responsiveness and stability, qualities that, together with the additional appeal of being able to drive in the open air, make it unrivalled. This special version not only multiplies the already extraordinary performance of the 296 GTS but also introduces a sense of predictability and intuitiveness that makes this a car unlike any other. Conceived for the Ferrarista who demands an unrivalled driving experience, the 296 Speciale A represents the new pinnacle for this model type and is dedicated to owners in search of that special feeling of being at the wheel of a car with extraordinary performance.The 296 Speciale A takes the agility and responsiveness of the 296 GTS to extreme new heights by exploiting the full potential of its plug-in hybrid architecture, consisting of a rear-mid 120° V6 twin turbo engine and an electric motor, a short wheelbase and innovative dynamic control systems. The drivetrain delivers an astonishing combined power output of 880 hp, 50 more than the 296 GTS and a record for a rear-wheel-drive production Ferrari.To make these results possible, Ferrari drew extensively from its experience in motor sports: the internal combustion engine borrows from the powerplant of the 296 Challenge in terms of engine management maps and boost strategy, and boasts titanium connecting rods, reinforced pistons and a lightened crankshaft. All these elements, together with a knock control system derived from Formula 1, have raised the power output of the V6 to 700 cv, 37 more than the model this special version is based on. The V6 engine of the 296 Speciale A maintains its distinctive timbre, a sound consisting of the pure harmonics of the 3rd, 6th, and 9th combustion orders which, in this application, have gained in quality, intensity and volume.The electric motor has also been uprated and is now capable of delivering 180 cv in the new extra boost mode. This increase in power has also made it possible to introduce a new strategy for the eight-speed DCT transmission, which makes use of additional torque during shifts to shorten shift times and increase both performance and driver engagement.The 296 Speciale A generates 435 kg of downforce at 250 km/h with the roof up – 20% more than the 296 GTS – thanks to innovative solutions developed and tested on the 296 Challenge. These include the aero damper integrated into the front bonnet and the vertical fins on the rear bumper which incorporate new side wings that work in synergy with the active rear spoiler to generate additional downforce. The spoiler is now managed by a new actuator control strategy that not only shortens the transition time between Low Drag (LD) and High Downforce (HD) configurations by 50% but also introduces a new Medium Downforce (MD) configuration, which improves rear-end stability at high speeds.A great deal of attention was dedicated to saving weight, which is crucial for increasing driving thrills. Overall weight has been reduced by 50 kg compared with the 296 GTS by using materials such as carbon fibre for some of the bodyshell parts and titanium for components in the engine. The resulting weight/power ratio is just 1.69 kg/cv, a record for a rear-wheel-drive Ferrari berlinetta spider.To accentuate the dynamic capabilities of the 296 Speciale A and ensure that the car behaves predictably when driven at the limit, Ferrari’s engineers also worked on fine-tuning the electronic control systems, suspension set-up and tyres. The 296 Speciale A is equipped with the latest generation of the ABS Evo dynamic control system, which improves braking precision and repeatability in all surface and grip conditions. The spring and damper settings have been revised – the car now rides 5 mm lower than the 296 GTS – reducing maximum roll angle when cornering by 13% and improving the behaviour of the car at the limit."

            "article": "Genesis today unveiled its bold new vision for the future of high-performance luxury. In an exciting debut in Dubai, the brand introduced Genesis Magma Racing, marking its first major milestone in the motorsport arena. The event showcased Genesis’ ambitions in endurance racing, illustrating the brand’s dedication to innovation, speed, and passion.Hyundai Motorsport GmbH (Hyundai Motorsport) underpinned the global race and rally activities for Hyundai Motor Group for over ten years and will now support the Genesis motorsport operations in the prestigious World Endurance Championship (WEC) in 2026, followed by participation in IMSA SportsCar Championship (IMSA) in 2027. This venture will position Genesis on the world’s most challenging tracks, showcasing the brand’s engineering expertise and endurance capabilities.Endurance racing represents one of the most prestigious and challenging disciplines in motorsport, demanding speed, reliability, and strategy over extended periods. Iconic events like the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Daytona 24 require teams to balance peak performance with durability and efficiency, testing both the cars and drivers to their limits. At the heart of endurance racing is the LMDh (Le Mans Daytona h) class—a premier category that combines cutting-edge hybrid technology with standardized components to ensure cost control and competitive parity. LMDh cars compete in WEC and IMSA, making them a global platform for showcasing engineering excellence and innovation.

            "article": "Genesis today revealed the X Gran Equator Concept, a bold exploration of elegance and adventure designed for those seeking the serenity of nature and the thrill of the unknown. As the brand's first adventure vehicle concept, the X Gran Equator Concept reimagines Genesis' \"Athletic Elegance\" design philosophy while embracing the rugged spirit of overlanding.“The X Gran Equator Concept is an exercise in harmonizing contrasts—combining elegance with ruggedness, and the spirit of exploration with refined comfort,” said Luc Donckerwolke, Chief Creative Officer of Genesis. “It represents the orchestration of true off-road competence and uncompromising luxury, designed to enable the discovery of the world’s most breathtaking landscapes.”Inspired by reductive design principles, the X Gran Equator Concept’s exterior emphasizes clean lines and uncluttered surfaces. A long hood, sleek cabin, and fast C-pillar create a silhouette that defies traditional SUV conventions, while dark wheel-arch cladding and 24-inch beadlock wheels underscore its off-road readiness. The geometric auxiliary lamps and split-opening tailgate blend practicality with Genesis’ signature Two-Line headlamps, ensuring the X Gran Equator is as purposeful as it is striking.Inside, the X Gran Equator Concept orchestrates contrast between analog architecture and digital technologies, crafting a space that feels both functional and evocative. At the center of the cabin is a four-circle display cluster on the center stack, inspired by the dials of vintage cameras. The interior design features contrasting colors and shapes, with a preference for geometric over organic elements. The dashboard's linear architecture and absence of decorations focus the driver's attention on the journey ahead, while swiveling front seats and modular storage solutions enhance practicality.The name draws inspiration from Equator, widely recognized as the \"finest stallion\" in the world of Arabian horses — a symbol of endurance, agility, and refined power. These qualities closely reflect the spirit of the concept: a vehicle that is both elegant and capable, engineered to perform in extreme conditions while maintaining a natural sense of grace. Just as the Arabian horse is known for its balance of beauty and strength, this concept embodies Genesis’ unique take on performance.The X Gran Equator Concept signals Genesis’ continued expansion into lifestyle-oriented vehicles, balancing sophistication with versatility. While not confirmed for production, its design language and innovative features—such as the integrated roof rails and split-opening tailgate—showcase the brand’s future design potential.The X Gran Equator Concept will be displayed at the Genesis booth during the 2025 New York International Auto Show, slated to open to the public on April 18 at Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Following the show, it will be on display at Genesis House in the Meatpacking District until the end of July."

            "article": "Hennessey Special Vehicles, the Texas-based hypercar manufacturer, has revealed the Venom F5 Evolution, the world’s most powerful internal combustion road car. Following an extensive development program, the next generation of America’s Hypercar features a comprehensive set of updates that boost overall performance, handling, and comfort.In partnership with world-renowned performance and aerodynamic specialists, and driven by customer demand, Hennessey’s team of engineers conducted an extensive development program to further enhance the hypercar’s capabilities. The new ‘Venom F5 Evolution’ has increased power and torque, updated aerodynamics for improved downforce, new mode-adaptive suspension for enhanced handling and ride quality, plus an optional touring exhaust system and touring seats.John Hennessey, company founder and CEO: “During the past three years we’ve delivered nearly 30 F5’s to clients all around the world. Some of our owners requested even more power, which led us to develop the new Hennessey Venom F5 Evolution – the world’s most powerful internal combustion-powered hypercar.”Engine Hennessey’s long-standing relationship with Shell Pennzoil and Roger Penske led to a partnership with high-performance engineering specialists Ilmor Engineering to further develop Hennessey’s 6.6-liter twin-turbo V8 engine, code named ‘Fury’. To take the Hennessey V8 powerplant to the next level of performance, durability, and drivability, Ilmor and Hennessey’s engineering teams significantly enhanced key elements of the engine and powertrain, including:Precision 76/80 Next Gen turbochargers – the largest mirror image turbos in the worldIlmor-designed oval-shaped billet aluminum pistons with optimized profile geometryExtreme-duty billet aluminum connecting rodsLightweight titanium exhaust valvesLightweight valve coversLarger high-flow fuel injectorsThe result is a powerful new engine design with extreme durability that enables a 0-200 mph time of just 10.3 seconds, while also being capable of client endurance racing. Ilmor’s refinements also brought the welcome byproduct of an additional 214 bhp, delivering the world’s most powerful road car combustion engine delivering 2031 bhp at 8000 rpm and 1445 lb-ft torque at 5200 rpm on environmentally friendly Shell E85 pump fuel.Suspension The F5 Evolution’s new adaptive suspension enables the driver to transform the car’s character by selecting each of the F5’s power modes via the steering-wheel-mounted toggle. Ride, handling, roll, pitch, and steering responsiveness is automatically set, enabling the driver to alter the hypercar’s set-up for anything from high-performance track driving to comfortable cruising.On road, the system delivers greater confidence when pushing hard on inconsistent surfaces while also absorbing bumps and compressions to make touring more relaxed. On track, performance is enhanced markedly making it possible to hold racing lines even more consistently and ride curbs harder, while benefitting from increased grip and turn-in precision. The new suspension is individually tuned to the Venom F5’s five selectable modes – Sport, Road Race, Drag, Wet, and the full-power F5 Mode.Aerodynamics Aero development drew heavily from a wealth of road, track, runway and wind-tunnel test data. Working with renowned Formula One and Indycar aerodynamicist Dr. Mark Handford, the team studied the whole car’s aerodynamics in new levels of detail.The results saw a complete redesign of the front splitter with the most significant changes made to the underside of the car. The Hennessey team also added single dive planes ahead of each front wheel, tire wake deflectors to the underside of the car, and a louvre above each front wheel arch. Working in partnership with the new suspension, a new Gurney lip at the trailing edge of the rear deck spoiler enhances high-speed stability under acceleration and braking.Comfort and design Hennesey’s design and engineering team developed a set of ‘Touring’ options, acknowledging the desire expressed by several Hennessey customers to take their F5 on longer road trips and rallies. The optional enhancements include alternatives to the lightweight carbon bucket seats and sports exhaust, even extending to the addition of a carbon fiber drinks holder. Following anthropometric studies, additional bolstering was added to the optional ‘Touring Carbon Seats’ for longer distance driving. Retaining an exposed carbon back, the new leather-wrapped Touring seats also feature a laser cut ‘blast off’ design to accentuate the ‘aerospace inspired’ interior.The Evolution package (enhanced engine, suspension, aerodynamics) is available for both newly ordered F5 models and to all existing Venom F5 owners across the Coupe, Roadster and Revolution models. The cost for the Evolution package is $285,000 with the optional Touring upgrades available at an additional cost."
